Advance Contract Award Notice (ACAN) An ACAN is a public notice indicating to the supplier community that a department or agency intends to award a contract for goods, services or construction to a pre-identified supplier, thereby allowing other suppliers to signal their interest in bidding, by submitting a statement of capabilities. If no supplier submits a statement of capabilities that meets the requirements set out in the ACAN, on or before the closing date stated in the ACAN, the contracting officer may then proceed with the award to the pre-identified supplier. 2. Definition of the requirement 2.1 Background Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) exists to repay the nation's debt of gratitude toward those whose courageous efforts have given us this legacy, and have contributed to our growth as a nation. Among the significant responsibilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs Act, the Minister of Veterans Affairs is charged with the care, treatment, or re-establishment in civil life of any person who served in the Canadian Forces or merchant navy or in the naval, army or air forces or merchant navies of Her Majesty, of any person who has otherwise engaged in pursuits relating to war, and of any other person designated and the care of the dependants or survivors of any person referred to. As a service oriented department, VAC is committed to serving our clients in the official language of their choice. To meet this commitment, an appropriate level of bilingual positions has been established in our Head Office as well as in offices across Canada. Our operating environment requires that we maintain strong language levels at all levels throughout the Department. Further, there has been a move away from staffing positions with a non-imperative requirement. In 2012, delivery of second language learning programs was decentralized from the Canada School of the Public Service (CSPS) to departments. As such, VAC is responsible for the delivery of second language programs for employees across Canada. It is significant to note that our Head Office is located in Charlottetown, PEI and that significant regional offices are dispersed in somewhat distant locations where the public demand for second language training is low. VAC has developed a Second Language Learning Strategy to coordinate the approach of language training in the Department. The strategy offers a flexible framework in which managers can make prudent and consistent decisions regarding language training needs. A key objective of the strategy is to improve Service to Clients. We must have a flexible learning model wherein employees' needs are met based on specific learning needs/preferences/accessibility. The Supplier must offer equitable access to French and English second language training through innovative and intelligent language instruction software with flexible options for one-on-one tutoring (by phone or in person) and group learning opportunities with qualified language teachers. LRDG software requires no additional 3rd party software. The products have been tested on all environments of desktop, laptop, work station and server environments and are fully compatible from Windows 98 through Windows 7, including Vista. The vendor does not require maintenance fees and VAC IT has demonstrated the software can be easily distributed in all VAC locations. 2.2 Objective The objective is to provide full-time and part-time second language training, in French and English to employees of VAC across Canada in order to: ensure that clients can be served in the official language of their choice; ensure the quality of our services in both official languages; promote the use of both official languages in the workplace; and establish a bilingual workplace. 2.3 Scope of Work VAC is looking for a solution which comprises eight components: a computer-based training delivered via a self-contained software product installed on individual computers (CD-ROM or DVD-ROM); a subscription-based training delivered via a web portal; a tutor-led training delivered in classroom, in virtual classroom and by telephone; a language proficiency level evaluation delivered by a web portal; an on-site SLE preparation course; a virtual SLE preparation course; a tutor-led SLE preparation session; and virtual lunch and learn sessions for oral maintenance. The proposed solution must also comply with the following principles: The second language training must be provided at the levels A, B, and C in accordance with the Government of Canada Qualification Standards in Relation to Official Languages (http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/gui/squn03-eng.asp). The second language training must be flexible to accommodate different employee schedules. Tutor-led training Estimated number of students per year* Estimated number of hours per year Classroom training 120 2000 Virtual classroom training 15 1650 Telephone training 75 3650 SLE Preparation 68 2500 * Due to the transitional period that VAC has been undergoing since the Canada School of the Public Service has decentralized responsibility for second language training, these figures are based on the usage of the past year. For each category, the actual usage may be more or less than the estimated figures. Estimated number of perpetual licenses** required Self-contained software (CD-ROM or DVD-ROM) 25 ** Perpetual licenses: a perpetual license must allow VAC to use the licensed software indefinitely. It must also allow VAC to download all updates to the software and to receive technical support. After the one year period ends, VAC can choose to remain with the last version downloaded or to purchase a 1year updates and support package, for 20% of the license price. There are no penalties for letting updates and support lapse for a while before purchasing an annual package. 2.4 Technical Environment The self-contained software and the web portal must run and function properly when implemented in the technical environment described below: Windows 98 through Windows 7, including Vista Must be compatible with Internet Explorer version 8 and above running on Microsoft Windows 7 Service Pack 1. Must be able to be packaged and delivered as a virtual application using Microsoft Application Virtualization technology (App-V) version 4.6. 2.5 Contractor's Responsibilities The Contractor must hold all intellectual property rights for the software, the web-portal and for all teaching materials; When tutoring services are provided online or by telephone, the Contractor must bear the costs for calls and any other costs associated with the delivery of online services; For the classroom tutoring, the Contractor must bear the costs for travel and living expenses; For the classroom tutoring, the Contractor must provide teaching aids such as pocket dictionaries and English and French verb conjugation books at no additional cost to VAC; The Contractor must provide technical assistance for the software and the web portal at no additional cost to VAC. The technical assistance for the software and the web portal must be available 5 days per week, from Monday to Friday, between 9 am and 4 pm in all Time Zones throughout Canada; The Contractor must deliver the software package (CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, and the software documentation) to the Technical Authority, 10 calendar days following the issuing of a Task Authorization; The Contractor must replace any defective CD-ROM or DVD-ROM within 5 calendar days at no additional cost to VAC; If an instructor is absent, the Contractor must replace it by an instructor with the minimum qualifications as stated in point g) and h), under Tutor Services Requirements; and The Contractor must distribute and ask each student to fill out the satisfaction forms at the end of their training. The Contractor must then forward the completed satisfaction forms to the Technical Authority. 2.6 VAC's Responsibilities VAC will provide the facilities and equipment required for the classroom tutoring; VAC must ensure that each user is following its training plan as scheduled.
