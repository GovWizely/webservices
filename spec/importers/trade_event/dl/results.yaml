    Line webcasts. Topic: Doing Business in Bangladesh’s Leather Sector Host: Ambassador
    Dan Mozena Date, time, time zone: Thursday, November 13, 2014; 10:00 a.m. EST
    (2100 BST) Brief description: Ambassador Mozena, a senior U.S. diplomat with years
    of experience in Bangladesh, will speak with participants about the incredible
    business opportunities which exist in Bangladesh in relation to the leather processing,
    producing, and manufacturing industries. Bangladesh is poised to become a global
    producer of leather goods (clothing, shoes, furniture, and industrial equipment),
    a large-scale importer of hides, a consumer of basic inputs and industrial systems
    for processing tannery byproducts in an environmentally sound way, and a participant
    in a wide variety of other market segments. The possibilities for U.S. businesses
    are huge and range from consumer-oriented retail imports from Bangladesh to U.S.
    exports of hides and high tech effluent processing plants. Bangladesh has 160
    million people in an area the size of the state of Iowa, is business friendly,
    and has experienced almost uninterrupted 6% GDP growth over the past 12 years.
    The Ambassador will be joined by Embassy economic and commercial experts. Deadline

    Market Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs Register to receive information
    on future Direct Line webcasts. Topic: Opportunities for U.S. Firms in Taiwan’s
    Digital Signage Market Host: Christopher J. Marut, Director of the American Institute
    in Taiwan Date, time, time zone: Wednesday, November 12, 2014; 6:00 p.m. EST (November
    13 at 7:00 a.m. local) Brief description: During this webinar a group of panelists
    will discuss opportunities for U.S. businesses in Taiwan’s digital signage market.
    Digital Signage is a type of visual display technology that uses liquid crystal
    display (LCD) panels, light emitting diodes (LEDs), projectors, and other techniques
    to remotely control and play digital content including images, videos, and other
    information. Companies in Taiwan’s digital signage industry are actively seeking
    to purchase software, applications and content from U.S. companies, including
    hardware-software integration solutions, a field in which U.S. software companies
    have a leading edge. Opportunities also abound for U.S. companies and trade associations
    to partner with Taiwan’s hardware manufacturers to produce integrated systems.
    According to industry estimates, the size of the global digital signage market
    is between US$13 and US$14 billion and continues to grow steadily. Industries
    that utilize digital signage include education, finance, healthcare, restaurants,
    retail, transportation, entertainment, and hospitality. Stakeholders in the digital
    signage industry include content developers, advertising agencies, display manufacturers,
    consumer electronics manufacturers, raw material & manufacturing equipment suppliers,
    semiconductor component vendors, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), accessories
    manufacturers, distributors and retailers, research and consulting organizations,
    and technology standards organizations. The discussion will be hosted by Christopher
    J. Marut, Director of the American Institute in Taiwan, and panelists will include
    Paul Flanigan, Executive Director of the Digital Screenmedia Association, Nick
    Jane, Chairman of Digital Signage Multimedia Alliance Taiwan, John Wang, CEO of
    IAdea Corporation, and Jeff Chang, Regional Business Development Manager, Intel
    Microelectronics Asia Ltd. Deadline for RSVPs: November 11, 2014 Please RSVP by
