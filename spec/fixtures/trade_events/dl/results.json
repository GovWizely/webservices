Bangladesh is poised to become a global producer of leather goods (clothing, shoes, furniture, and industrial equipment), a large-scale importer of hides, a consumer of basic inputs and industrial systems for processing tannery byproducts in an environmentally sound way, and a participant in a wide variety of other market segments. The possibilities for U.S. businesses are huge and range from consumer-oriented retail imports from Bangladesh to U.S. exports of hides and high tech effluent processing plants. Bangladesh has 160 million people in an area the size of the state of Iowa, is business friendly, and has experienced almost uninterrupted 6% GDP growth over the past 12 years.

    "description": "Direct Line: Opportunities for U.S. Firms in Taiwan's Digital Signage Market Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs Register to receive information on future Direct Line webcasts. Topic: Opportunities for U.S. Firms in Taiwan’s Digital Signage Market Host: Christopher J. Marut, Director of the American Institute in Taiwan Date, time, time zone: Wednesday, November 12, 2014; 6:00 p.m. EST (November 13 at 7:00 a.m. local) Brief description: During this webinar a group of panelists will discuss opportunities for U.S. businesses in Taiwan’s digital signage market. Digital Signage is a type of visual display technology that uses liquid crystal display (LCD) panels, light emitting diodes (LEDs), projectors, and other techniques to remotely control and play digital content including images, videos, and other information. Companies in Taiwan’s digital signage industry are actively seeking to purchase software, applications and content from U.S. companies, including hardware-software integration solutions, a field in which U.S. software companies have a leading edge. Opportunities also abound for U.S. companies and trade associations to partner with Taiwan’s hardware manufacturers to produce integrated systems. According to industry estimates, the size of the global digital signage market is between US$13 and US$14 billion and continues to grow steadily. Industries that utilize digital signage include education, finance, healthcare, restaurants, retail, transportation, entertainment, and hospitality. Stakeholders in the digital signage industry include content developers, advertising agencies, display manufacturers, consumer electronics manufacturers, raw material & manufacturing equipment suppliers, semiconductor component vendors, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), accessories manufacturers, distributors and retailers, research and consulting organizations, and technology standards organizations. The discussion will be hosted by Christopher J. Marut, Director of the American Institute in Taiwan, and panelists will include Paul Flanigan, Executive Director of the Digital Screenmedia Association, Nick Jane, Chairman of Digital Signage Multimedia Alliance Taiwan, John Wang, CEO of IAdea Corporation, and Jeff Chang, Regional Business Development Manager, Intel Microelectronics Asia Ltd.
