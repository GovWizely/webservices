The RTM will introduce the delegation to U.S. firms that export technology, services and products that can assist China in developing the country's shale gas resources. The reverse trade mission will take place June 23 July 3, 2014 and will include stops in Washington, D.C and Pittsburgh, PA. As part of its 11-day tour in the U.S., the Chinese delegation will brief U.S. companies on the status of the China shale gas industry in Houston on July 1, 2014 at the Omni Houston Hotel from 9 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. The Energy Information Administration estimates that China's risked technically recoverable shale gas reserves are 1,115 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), trailing only the United States. China is fully committed to developing this resource. Attending companies will be able to meet one-on-one with the delegates as part of the program.
