    How do you evaluate the product/system? What are the effects on the company’s
    existing credit policy? What are the challenges faced such as integration with
    other systems like ERP, CRM Finance, etc.? How successful are bolt-on products?
    Bespoke or standard software solutions? Adherence to audit and compliance procedures—what
    are the obstacles? How do you manage the process through to implementation? Above
    is a short-list of the many factors that can arise when embarking on this process.
    This Roundtable series will provide a global generic template of helpful hints
