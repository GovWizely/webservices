  :title: ATA Carnet and Temporary Imports
  :short_title: ATA Carnet and Temporary Imports
  :summary: Temporary importation provisions for companies or professionals to show
    their products in foreign markets for a limited period of time.
  :creation_date: '2014-08-27'

  :content: ' ​​Temporary importation provisions are an important tool for companies
    who want to show their products in foreign markets or for professionals bringing
    tools of the trade into a foreign country for a limited period of time. Companies
    have several options when considering temporary importation. These include: ATA
    Carnets, Temporary Importation Bond (TIB) and entry withduty drawback. There is
    also provision for bringing "tools of trade" allowed for in the North American
    Free Trade Agreement. The ATA Carnet system is the most user-friendly system of
    temporary importation; however, there are a number of countries that do not accept
    carnets. In these countries, companies can post TIBs or apply for a duty drawback
    as an alternative means to duty free importation.  What Is An ATA Carnet?  ATA
    Carnet (a. k. a. "Merchandise Passport") is an international customs document
    accepted by 75 countries and territories. ATA Carnet allows temporary entry of
    goods, duty-free and tax-free, whether shipped or hand-carried. ATA Carnet system
    was established by international ATA convention and is governed by World Customs
    Organization and International Chamber of Commerce and its World Chambers Federation
    to encourage world trade and reduce trade barriers created by different national
    customs regulations. The initials "ATA" are from the French and English words
    "Admission Temporaire/ Temporary Admission." U.S. Customs appointedUS Council
    for International Businessas National Guaranteeing Association (NGA).  Companies
    are required to present carnet documentation to U. S. Customs when leaving the
    country and upon entry into and exit from the foreign country. Upon return, the
    company must again show the carnet document to U. S. Customs for duty-free entry
    back into the United States. The ATA carnet also serves as the registration of
    goods for the U.S. and eliminates the need for aU.S. Customs Certificate of Registration
    Form 4455. ATA Carnets cover most personal and professional goods, including commercial
    samples, professional equipment and goods intended for use at trade shows and
    exhibitions. The ATA Carnets do not cover consumable or disposable items. They
    are also not recommended for situations where some of the products taken abroad
    may be sold in a foreign country. However, they are particularly useful when a
    product may "travel" to several countries prior to being returned to the United
    States.  Where Can I Use A Carnet?  The ATA Carnet is accepted by many countries
    and territories worldwide. For a completelist of countries and territories that
    accept carnets, contact information as well as countries not covered by the ATA
    carnets contact US Council for International Business:  ATA Carnet Department
    1212 Avenue of the Americas New York, NY 10036 Telephone: (866) 786-5625 or (800)
    5DUTYFREE (538-8937); Fax: (212) 944-0012 Email:atacarnet@uscib.org           What
    are the benefits of the ATA Carnet?   Eliminate duties and value-added taxes (VAT);  Simplify
    customs procedures allowing a temporary exporter to use a single document for
    all customs transactions, make arrangements in advance, and at a predetermined
    cost;  Allow for an unlimited entries/departures for up to one year;  Facilitate
    reentry into the U.S. by eliminating the need to register the goods with U.S.
    Customs at the time of departure;  Eliminate need to file anElectronic Export
    Informationform (former Shipper''s Export Declaration) except for those exports
    that require an export license;  Eliminate the need for Temporary Importation
    Under Bond (TIB).   Note of caution: ATA Carnets DO NOT exempt the holders from
    obtaining necessary licenses or permits.)  How Do I Apply For an ATA Carnet?  ATA
    carnet application is a three-part process.   General list  Carnet application,
    and  Security deposit.   ATA Carnets may be obtained from theUSCIBor from two
    officially-appointed Carnet Service Providers:Boomerang Freight SolutionsandRoanoke
    Trade Services. In addition to the three Carnet issuing entities, exporters may
    contact other parties including brokers and freight forwarders who can assist
    with the preparation of an ATA carnet; however, the carnets will be issued by
    the designated service providers.  Exporters can obtain ATA Carnets and carnet
    bonds services via an online application process.  All carnet applicants must
    be furnished with a security deposit in the form of cash or bond by USCIB or the
    two service providers. The deposit acts as collateral and will be drawn upon to
    reimburse the USCIB in the event it incurs a liability or loss in connection with
    the carnet or its use. Cash deposits are returned in full and bonds are terminated
    once the original carnet has been returned and no claims are anticipated by the
    USCIB.  How Much Does A Carnet Cost?  The value of the shipment determinescarnet
    processing fees.  How Long Does It Take To Process A Carnet?  It can take two
    business days to process a carnet application if the application and security
    deposit are received by 4:00 pm ET. Applications received after 4:00 pm will be
    processed the following business day or will incur an expedited service fee.  What
    If I Lose My Carnet Documents?  The USCIB or its two designated service providers
    offer warranty coverage for lost, stolen, or destroyed carnet forms for a fee.
    The USCIB will issue an immediate replacement to customers with this warranty.
    Full terms and conditions of carnet warranties are available when submitting an
    application electronically, or by contacting an ATA Carnet consultant for details.  Can
    I Sell The Goods Covered Under Carnet?  Carnets are NOT recommended for goods
    intended for sale. Should some of the goods be sold, Carnets are subject to a
    penalty equal to 10% of the amount of the duties and taxes in addition to the
    payment of duties and taxes for the goods sold off. A USCIBClaims Handling Feemay
    also apply.  For goods sold off ATA Carnet, a company needs to contact a local
    customs office to determine the most appropriate procedure. Some countries such
    as U.K. and Australia tightly control the sale of goods accompanied by carnets.
    Generally, local customs will request that the goods and ATA Carnets be brought
    to the local office prior to Carnet expiration so that the Carnet may be properly
    discharged and duties, taxes, and penalty paid.  Companies are advised to obtain
    an itemized customs receipt noting the items sold, amount paid, and ATA Carnet
    number. The original ATA Carnet and a copy of the Customs receipt need to be sent
    to the USCIB. It is important to retain a clear copy of the Carnet for the record.  If
    you have questions, contact USCIB Claims Administration at 212.703.5075 orazhang@uscib.org.  If
    A Country Does Not Accept Carnets, What Are My Alternatives?  For countries that
    do not accept carnets, companies can apply for a Temporary Importation Bond (TIB),
    documents which can be purchased from a customs broker at the time of entry. TIB
    deposits and payments are usually made in cash in the currency of the importing
    country. TIBs must also be posted each time a product is imported. Fees for posting
    TIBs vary across countries and depend on the type of product being imported. Companies
    should expect that it might take several months before the cash deposits are refunded.  Another
    alternative to a carnet is the duty drawback for temporary imports, a process
    whereby importers register the goods at the time of entry into a foreign country
    by making a consumption entry and deposit the applicable duties and taxes with
    the importing country''s customs authority. Like TIBs, the deposit and payment
    are usually made in cash and in the currency of the importing country. At the
    time of departure, the foreign customs authority will inspect and collect the
    appropriate paperwork for the product. Companies will receive a partial refund
    of the duties and taxes posted under the duty drawback in the future.  Companies
    should contact a customs broker in the importing country to post TIBs or apply
    for aduty drawback.  What Are My Options For Temporary Importation Under North
    American Free Trade Agreement?  Companies that need to send temporary exports
    can take advantage of special provisions under the North American Free Trade Agreement
    (NAFTA) and avoid paying duties. NAFTA requires Canada, Mexico and the United
    States to grant duty- free temporary admission to certain classes of goods imported
    from another NAFTA country. In addition, under its service provisions, the agreement
    provides "tools of the trade" arrangements that allow U. S. companies to send
    their service personnel, along with their tools, to a NAFTA country. The goods
    do not have to originate in a NAFTA country to qualify for temporary entry provisions.  ATA
    Carnets are accepted in Canada. However, many goods are already traded duty- free
    between the United States and Canada, which makes carnets less important than
    in other countries. In addition, there are many categories of goods for which
    Canada permits temporary entry under a special schedule if the exporter completes
    aTemporary Admission Permit, and, where required, a Canada Customs Coding Form.
    Many temporary imports fall into one of these categories and can be imported duty-free.
    Temporary imports must also be classified under theHarmonized Tariff System (HTS)number
    associated with temporary imports into Canada, under Chapter 98. '
