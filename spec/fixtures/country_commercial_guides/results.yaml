  :content: '![Automotive Market](images/automotive-market.png)  Colombia is a major
    player in the regional automotive market. The Colombian automotive sector experienced
    a decrease of 7 percent from 2012 to 2013. Despite this decline, 2013 was the
    third best year of auto sales ever in Colombia. Auto parts sales were US$3.780
    billion, declining also 7 percent from 2012 to 2013.  According to the leading
    automotive parts industry association in Colombia, Asopartes among the reasons
    for this reduction are: a) new technologies have made auto parts last longer,
    b) sales underreporting c) an increase in the sale of illegal used auto parts,
    and d) smuggling (contraband of automotive parts).1  ######1 Informe Venta Autopartes,
    2013, Asopartes  At the beginning of 2013 there were 9.3 million vehicle units
    in the country, according to data from the Ministry of Transportation. Of those,
    507,355 were registered for transportation (freight and passengers). According
    to research conducted by the multinational banking group BBVA in 2013, Colombia’s
    vehicle stock will increase by 3.5 million between 2010 and 2020.2  The same study
    establishes that the automotive sector contributes to 4 percent of the country’s
    GDP and employs about 3.2 percent of the country’s population. Colombia currently
    ranks as the third largest automobile manufacturer in Latin America. In addition,
    after Brazil, Colombia is the second largest motorcycle producer in the region,
    with an annual output of 515,000 motorcycles.  A number of international auto
    manufacturers currently produce vehicles in Colombia. General Motors (GM), based
    in Bogota, has an annual capacity of about 100,000 units, and in 2013 opened a
    stamping plant to manufacture and export the body sections to markets in Central
    America and South America. Renault, based in Medellin, has an annual capacity
    of 80,000 units. Mazda Motor, also based in Bogota, has a capacity of 15,000 units
    annually. Automaker Daimler''s subsidiary Daimler Colombia operates a CKD assembly
    facility in Bogota.3  68 brands and 267 models are found in the market. The biggest
    seller is Chevrolet, followed by Renault and Kia. Nissan has grown at a fast rate
    in recent years, and is in fourth place.4  In 2012, the percentage of nationally
    produced vehicles was 40 percent. The other 60 percent of vehicles were imported
    from South Korea, Mexico, India, Japan, Ecuador, China, and the United States.
    The high import percentage represents good opportunities for all imported parts
    and accessories, especially those from the United States, which are very well
    known and regarded nationwide.  Firms from more than 106 countries compete to
    supply the Colombian automotive parts market. The United States, Brazil, Japan
    and China have the highest market shares. Firms from the United States and Brazil
    compete with quality and state-of-the-art products, while firms from many Asian
    countries have obtained a larger market share pursuing a low price strategy and
    offering lower quality.  The annual production of automotive parts in Colombia
    is equivalent to US$1.068 billion of which 47 percent is exported (US$499 billion)
    to Venezuela, Ecuador, the United States, Germany, and South Africa. Imports represented
    US$4.059 billion. Main countries of origin are the United States (16 percent),
    China (14 percent), Japan (8 percent), and India (7 percent).5  Colombian end-users
    of automotive parts and accessories are numerous, varied, and difficult to quantify
    because of the wide variety of brands found in the local market and the number
    of motor vehicles imported.  ######2 BBVA Research " Automobile Market Outlook,

    Colombian vehicles are for private use; 14 percent are in public service and 3
    percent are for official use (not including those owned by the Ministry of Transportation,

  :content: 'With regard to auto parts, Colombia is the United States’ fifth largest
    trading partner in Latin America and the United States is Colombia’s third largest
    trading partner after China and Mexico. Colombia’s competitive economy provides
    opportunities for U.S. manufacturers. Two main areas for opportunities in the
    automotive industry in Colombia are:  1. Vehicles: Public transport systems in
    the principal cities (Bogota, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Cali, Pereira,
    among others). Cities will increase the purchase of new vehicles and a standardization
    of existing models. The city of Bogota launched the “Plan de Ascenso Tecnológico”,
    (Technological Improvement Plan) a technology improvement plan for zero or low
    carbon emissions in the mass transportation sector for Bogota – Transmilenio Bus
    Rapid Transit (BRT). The plan contemplates replacing the current fleet with low
    emission buses.  2. Auto parts: The high vehicle import percentage represents
    good opportunities for all imported parts and accessories, especially for U.S.
    products which are very well known and regarded nationwide. Additionally, under
    the FTA agreement which entered entered into effect on May 15, 2012, some parts
    and auto parts (which were previously assessed a tariff of 13 percent on average)
    currently enter the Colombian market tariff free, while tariffs on other parts
    will be reduced to zero over the next 5-10 years.  With this implementation Colombia
    is accepting re-manufactured auto parts listed under Chapter Four, Rules of Origin
    and Origin Procedures, Section A - Rules of Origin, ANNEX 4.18. Goods classified
    in the following Harmonized System subheadings may be considered remanufactured
    goods that would be allowed to be imported into Colombia 8702, 8703, 8704.21,8704.31,
    8704.32, 8706, and 8707:8408.10, 8408.20, 8408.90, 8409.91, 8409.99, 8412.21,

    8708.93,8708.99,9031.49.  Other provisions of the FTA include strong protection
    for U.S. investors (legal stability), expanded access to service markets, greater
    intellectual property rights protection, market access for remanufactured goods,
    increased transparency and improved dispute settlement mechanisms (arbitration).
    Under the National Treatment Caveat within the FTA, U.S. companies must be treated
    as locals when they participate in public bids, eliminating the disadvantage they
    used to face prior to the signing of the agreement.  Other end-users are as follows:  *
    Dealers and Distributors of Imported Vehicles * Freight and Passenger Transportation
    Companies  * Importers and Distributors of Automotive Parts and Accessories *
    Repair and Maintenance Shops Service Stations, Gasoline Dealers and Lubrication
    Centers  * Tire Distributors * Government Agencies Other End-Users: rental car
    and limousine companies. '

  :content: "![hardware](images/hardware.png)  Colombia’s internal and external defense
    and security structure includes the Army, Navy (includes Marines and Coast Guard),
    Air Force, and the National Police. The total military spending increased from
    US$ 14.7 billion in 2012 to US$ 15.1 billion in 2013 7 (this figure includes,
    not only hardware investment indicated in the tables above, but also the addition
    of other budgets such as all cost related to the functioning of military forces,
    the police, their public benefits, the functioning of Satena Airlines, military
    housing, and other costs). The total military spending has been on average 3.7
    percent of the country’s total GDP (2009 to 2013)8. Under Plan Colombia, significant
    U.S. funding, technical assistance, and equipment support has been provided to
    Colombian- led counter narcotic programs for drug eradication and interdiction,
    and expansion of the capacity of Colombian military and police. The current format
    of Plan Colombia expired in 2012, with the consequent nationalization of military
    programs by the Colombian government. For 2014 some spending may shift to drug
    eradication and peace keeping programs, especially if the peace negotiations that
    are currently undergoing with the FARC Rebel forces in Cuba are achieved. Despite
    the peace negotiations process, the Colombian government is expected to continue
    military actions and spending to fight  ######6 [http://www.gsed.gov.co/irj/go/km/docs/Mindefensa/Documentos/descargas/Sobre_el_Ministerio/Planeacion/Presupuesto/Presupuesto

    \ narco-terrorism, and gain security area through its police force, especially
    to develop security surveillance and enforcement in remote and isolated regions
    of the country.  Through the Foreign Military Sales Trust Fund, the U.S. Department
    of Defense (DOD) provides equipment and training to the Colombian military and
    police through military assistance programming. The Department of State (DOS),
    military sales, and the international narcotics control program are other sources
    of funding. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs
    has been the main source of funding for equipment acquisition in Colombia since
    1990, through private military consulting firms. These firms operate through an
    open market competitive bidding system. However, U.S. funding is expected to significantly
    decrease at a rate of 10 percent per annum over the next five years. The Colombian
    congress approved Law 80 of 1993, under which procurement of goods and services
    for security and national defense made in Colombia by local manufacturers, must
    be purchased over goods made by foreign manufacturers and exporters9. However,
    under the National Treatment Caveat, Chapter 9 United States-Colombia bilateral
    trade agreement (FTA), U.S. companies must be treated as locals when they participate
    on public bids eliminating the disadvantage they used to face prior to the signing
    of the agreement.  In 2002, the Colombian government created a Wealth Tax to collect
    US$ 800 million from large companies and wealthy individuals, 70 percent of which
    was used to increase 2002-2003 defense spending. A similar tax in 2007- 2011 collected
    close to US$ 3.7 billion, of which a significant portion funded defense spending.
    The Colombian Army receives 60 percent of the funding, followed by the Air Force
    with 25 percent and the National Police with 10 percent.  The United States has
    had a privileged relationship with Colombia in regards to military equipment acquisitions;
    however, new competitors from England, France, South Korea, and Spain have gained
    some notoriety. The Colombian military tends to use standardized equipment and
    values relationships, trust and familiarity with equipment (as exemplified by
    their consistent use of the same type of rifles). However, foreign manufacturers
    are gaining market share. According to the unofficial estimates, U.S. imports
    represent close to 50 percent of the total imports of military equipment.  The
    Colombian military keeps high standards for its equipment, which historically
    was a great opportunity for American products. However, the United States could
    lose market share in the future due to pricing and more competitive bidding from
    foreign manufacturers. U.S. manufactured equipment is already losing market share
    for personal arms, with more rifles currently being bought from Australia, Belgium
    and Russia. Additional examples of non U.S. military products being used in Colombia
    include: British-made Hoover Crafts, French 105mm Obuses, and local Colombian
    manufacturing of various products including aluminum flat boats. "
