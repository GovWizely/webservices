However, recent controls have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina more difficult as the Argentine Government has implemented more processes that Argentine importers must complete in order to import goods into the country. This report summarizes several Argentine government regulations that U.S. companies should be aware of as they access the Argentine market. 



All potential exporters to Argentina are urged to contact the U.S. Commercial Service in Buenos Aires before shipping any goods as conditions and restrictions can change suddenly.  Please see the contact information at the end of this report. <MRL_COL_END> x_4268342.pdf                                                               <MRL_COL_END>  <MRL_COL_END> 14271731 <MRL_COL_END> Process Obstacles to Exporting to Argentina                                                                                                                                                                                                                    <MRL_COL_END> Aerospace & Defense|Agribusiness|Apparel & Textiles|Automotive & Ground Transportation|Chemicals, Petrochemicals & Composites|Construction, Building & Heavy Equipment|Consumer Goods & Home Furnishings|Energy & Mining|Environmental Technologies|Food Processing & Packaging|Health Technologies|Industrial Equipment & Supplies|Information & Communication|Marine Industries|Paper, Printing, Graphic Arts|Security & Safety|Services|Used & Reconditioned Equipment <MRL_COL_END> 2013-09-13 10:02:24 <MRL_COL_END> 2014-12-30 00:00:00 <MRL_COL_END> 1900-01-01 00:00:00 <MRL_COL_END> 1900-01-01 00:00:00 <MRL_COL_END> Market Research [International]                    <MRL_ROW_END>
