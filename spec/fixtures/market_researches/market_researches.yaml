  :description: Argentina remains a key market for U.S. exports to Latin America.
    However, recent controls have made exporting goods from any country to Argentina
    more difficult as the Argentine Government has implemented more processes that
    Argentine importers must complete in order to import goods into the country. This
    report summarizes several Argentine government regulations that U.S. companies
    should be aware of as they access the Argentine market. All potential exporters
    to Argentina are urged to contact the U.S. Commercial Service in Buenos Aires
    before shipping any goods as conditions and restrictions can change suddenly.
    Please see the contact information at the end of this report.
