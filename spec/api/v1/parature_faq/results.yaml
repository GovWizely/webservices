  :question: Can U.S. companies self-certify for the CE Marking?
  :answer: 'Most products covered by New Approach Directives can be self-certified
    by the manufacturer and do not require the intervention of an EU-authorized testing/certifying
    company called a notified body. To self-certify, the manufacturer must assess
    the conformity of the products to the applicable directives and standards. While
    the use of EU harmonized standards is voluntary in theory, in practice the use
    of European standards is the best way to meet the requirements of the CE marking
    directives, especially in the case of the Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)
    and Low Voltage Directives. (The word "harmonized" means that the standards have
    been approved by all 27 European Union countries). The standards offer specific
    guidelines and tests to meet safety requirements, while the directives are more
    general and do not, in most cases, offer detailed specifications on how to meet
    safety requirements. The Machine Directive, however, does offer more detailed
    information on how to meet safety requirements than most other CE marking directives.
    U.S. companies can self-certify to the CE marking requirements of the Machine
    Directive by meeting the provisions of the directive whether they use European,
    international or U.S. standards. The manufacturer may affix the CE marking to
    his product once he''s prepared a declaration of conformity, the certificate which
    shows the product conforms to the applicable requirements. He must maintain a
    technical file to prove conformity. The manufacturer or his authorized representative
    must be able to provide this certificate together with the technical file at any
    time, if requested by the appropriate member state authorities. There is no specific
    form for the declaration of conformity but specific information is required. The
    declaration must include the following: the manufacturer''s name and address;
    the product description; the CE marking directives that apply to the product the
    European standards used; and, the signature of a company official for purposes
    of the company assuming liability for the safety of its product in the European
    market.'

  :question: Despite my CE marking why does my importer ask for an A.TR-1 Certificate?
    What is the A.TR-1-Certificate?
  :answer: In the early stages of EU directives implementation, the Government of
    Turkey exhibited a bias towards CE marked products originating in Europe. The
    Government was suspicious of certificates of conformity originating outside of
    the European Union. The A.TR-1 Certificate is a document that establishes that
    goods are freely allowed to be sold to Turkey within the scope of Turkey's Customs
    Union with the European Union. Initially, companies were able to clear Turkish
    Customs easily by providing the Certificate of Conformity and the A.TR-1. Companies
    asked to ship via the European Union or are asked to acquire an A.TR-1 Certificate
    should contact the U.S. Embassy's Commercial Section for resolution of this matter.
    Any U.S. company providing evidence of directives conformity should be allowed
    access to the Turkish market without having to transship via the European continent.

  :question: Do Turkish manufacturers need to confirm conformity of the EU New Approach
    (CE) Directives?
  :answer: In April 2004, the Government of Turkey announced the adoption of the CE
    marking for imported products only. The Government of Turkey (Ministry of Industry,
    the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the Ministry of Health) will need
    to promulgate regulations and legislation to have local companies also produce
    in compliance to the CE marking. At this time, the European Commission has not
    approved a Notified Body in Turkey. Therefore, Turkish companies requiring Notified
    Body conformity assessments must have products tested outside of Republic of Turkey.

  :question: Does Turkey now require the CE Marking?
  :answer: '1. My importer informed me that products being exported to Turkey require
    CE marking - is that true? On April 2004, The Government of Turkey''s Undersecretariat
    for Foreign Trade announced the implementation of twenty-three European Union
    industrial directives, which would affect an estimated 70% of the manufactured
    products imported into Turkey. The Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade has adopted
    the EU''s Low Voltage Directive, the Simple Pressure Vessels Directive, the Gas
    Appliances Directive, the Hot Water Boilers Directive, the EMC, the Machinery
    Directive, the Civil Explosives Directive, the Weighing Instruments Directive,
    the Equipment and Protective Systems Intended in Explosive Atmospheres Directive,
    the Lifts Directive (elevators), the Household Refrigerator/Freezer Directive,
    the Pressure Equipment Directive, the Noise Emission Directive, the Energy Efficiency
    for Ballast for Fluorescent Lighting Directive, the Active Implantable Medical
    Device Directive, the Medical Device Directive, the In Vitro Diagnostics Device
    Directive, the Toy Directive, the Recreational Water Craft Directive, the Construction
    Equipment Directive, the Personal Protective Equipment Directive, the Radio and
    Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive and the Cableway Directive (ski
    lifts and gondolas). All products that are deemed to fall within the European
    Union (EU) directives would need to conform to the directives in order to be sold
    in Turkey. 2. My importer informed me that I need a Certificate of Conformity
    issued by a Notified Body/Laboratory, is this true? Equipment meeting the directive
    definition of products needing to conform to EU technical regulations must have
    evidence of meeting the requirements either through verified laboratory testing
    conducted by an EU approved notified body or by manufacturer''s self-declaration
    if the directive dictates. Companies selling to the Turkish market must submit
    evidence of conformity compliance (CE Marking) either by providing a notarized/consularized
    conformity certificate from a notified body or a corporate issued certificate
    of conformity, which declares compliance of all relevant standards and directive
    annexes. If the EU directives allow for company or self-declaration of conformity,
    then this would need to be accepted by the Republic of Turkey as well. For companies
    having difficulty in having its corporate declaration approved by the Government
    of Turkey, please contact Commercial Assistant Ms. Ozge Cirika at Ozge.Cirika@mail.doc.gov.
    3. I supplied a corporate certificate of conformity with my shipping documents,
    why are my goods still detained at Turkish Customs? As Turkey has adopted the
    European Union New Approach Directives, it is still undergoing a learning process
    as to what are the Directives and what is CE marking. Exporters and importers
    are often asked for Certificates of Conformity prepared by EU recognized Notified
    Bodies. If a customs detainment takes place for companies that are allowed to
    self certify conformity based on the EU directives (i.e. low voltage, electromagnetic
    compatibility, portions of the machinery directive etc.), you would only need
    to contact Ms. Ozge Cirika at Ozge.Cirika@mail.doc.gov, and the Undersecretariat
    for Foreign Trade will be notified and a request to have the shipment released
    would be made. 5. I have been selling to the European Union without CE marking,
    why am I required to have CE marking for Turkey? As Turkey implemented the New
    Approach (CE marking) directives, it is still undergoing a learning process. Given
    that there is a full range of products not falling under the CE marking regulations,
    not all products are required to be CE marked or need to conform to EU standards.
    If companies find that the Government of Turkey asks for CE marking when none
    is required, please contact Ms. Cirika at Ozge.Cirika@mail.doc.gov immediately.
    The Commercial Section will request that the Undersecretariat for Foreign Trade
    inform both Turkish Customs and the appropriate ministries to have the shipment
    released. 6. My importer informs me that my CE marked product would need to be
    inspected by the Turkish Standards Institute-is this true? When Turkey adopted
    the European New Approach Directive, products that are deemed to conform to the
    directives would not need to be inspected by the Turkish Standards Institute.
    As is the case in the EU, if Customs officers or the Government of Turkey believe
    that a product bearing CE marking may not be in conformity with the EU regulations,
    Turkish testing could be authorized. For U.S. companies being asked to have its
    products undergo additional Turkish Standards Institute testing despite evidence
    of directives conformity, please contact the Commercial Service in Ankara immediately.
    7. Despite my CE marking why does my importer ask for an A.TR-1 Certificate? What
    is the A.TR-1-Certificate? In the early stages of EU directives implementation,
    the Government of Turkey exhibited a bias towards CE marked products originating
    in Europe. The Government was suspicious of certificates of conformity originating
    outside of the European Union. The A.TR-1 Certificate is a document that establishes
    that goods are freely allowed to be sold to Turkey within the scope of Turkey''s
    Customs Union with the European Union. Initially, companies were able to clear
    Turkish Customs easily by providing the Certificate of Conformity and the A.TR-1.
    Companies asked to ship via the European Union or are asked to acquire an A.TR-1
    Certificate should contact the U.S. Embassy''s Commercial Section for resolution
    of this matter. Any U.S. company providing evidence of directives conformity should
    be allowed access to the Turkish market without having to transship via the European
    continent. 8. Do Turkish manufacturers need to confirm conformity of the EU New
    Approach (CE) Directives? In April 2004, the Government of Turkey announced the
    adoption of the CE marking for imported products only. The Government of Turkey
    (Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the Ministry
    of Health) will need to promulgate regulations and legislation to have local companies
    also produce in compliance to the CE marking. At this time, the European Commission
    has not approved a Notified Body in Turkey. Therefore, Turkish companies requiring
    Notified Body conformity assessments must have products tested outside of Republic
    of Turkey. 9. Who can I call on if I have a standards problem in Turkey? The United
    States Embassy''s Commercial Section has been assisting U.S. companies, which
    meet EU directives conformity, in having products clear Turkish Customs as expeditiously
    as possible. The Commercial Section is also working to have the Government of
    Turkey accept CE conformity certification from U.S. corporations or Notified Bodies,
    without having U.S. companies face additional bureaucratic delays at customs and
    additional testing at the Turkish Standards Institute. For additional assistance
    in navigating the CE Marking regulations in Turkey, please contact our Commercial
    Assistant at Ozge.Cirika@mail.doc.gov. 10. Where can I find information on the
    CE Marking on the Internet? For additional information on the European Union Directives
    and European standards, please check the websites listed below: http://ts.nist.gov/Standards/Conformity/export-eu.cfm

  :question: How do European standards relate to the CE Marking?
  :answer: 'Prior to the harmonization of standards under the New Approach, each European
    country developed its own standards through a national standards body. The new
    system provides for three standards bodies to create standards on a Europe-wide
    scale: The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) in Brussels, Belgium;
    the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) in Brussels;
    3) the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) in Sophia Antipolis,
    France. CENELEC activities are in the electrotechnical sector, while ETSI specializes
    in telecommunications. CEN covers all other sectors. CEN and CENELEC''s principal
    members are national standards bodies, while ETSI''s membership incorporates a
    wider range of interested parties. These three are the only bodies that can develop
    a European standard (EN). When work on a European standard begins in one of these
    standards bodies, work on a corresponding national standard must stop. European
    standards, like European laws and European conformity assessment procedures, preempt
    and replace national (member state) standards. The European standards (ENs) that
    play a role in New Approach Directives are known as "harmonized standards." These
    standards supporting European legislation: are mandated by the European Commission;
    have been developed by the European standards bodies listed above, and address
    essential requirements of the New Approach Directives. These standards become
    officially recognized as harmonized standards when they are cited in the Official
    Journal of the European Communities. There is a vast body of European standards
    that is not mandated by the European Commission. These standards are not directed
    towards either the Old Approach or the New Approach Directives. While the use
    of these standards is in theory voluntary, they can support claims of a product''s
    quality either for marketing or legal purposes. These standards cover such products
    as furniture, household appliances (non-electrical), sports equipment, carpeting,
    footwear and small hand-held tools (which are not covered by the Machinery Directive).
    They define characteristics such as durability, appearance, and quality.'

  :question: Is ISO 9000 required in order to get the CE Marking?
  :answer: ISO 9000 registration (or EN 29000 certification) is used widely in Europe
    on a voluntary basis as a condition of acceptance of a manufacturer's product
    or as a way of recognizing the manufacturer's credibility. While a quality system
    such as ISO 9000 indicates that a company has an efficient organization structure
    and has low failure costs, it does not always certify conformity with the CE marking
    directives. However, some directives require use of a quality management system
    as part of the conformity assessment. For example, the Machine Directive requires
    manufacturers to set up a quality control system to make sure that future products
    coming off an assembly line meet CE marking requirements. However, the quality
    control system does not have to be ISO 9000, although ISO 9000 is a good choice,
    since it is widely recognized. The Medical Device Directive does require ISO 9000
    (EN 13485) as part of the conformity assessment process.

  :question: Once a U.S. company has certified its product with the CE Marking, is
    its work done?
  :answer: No, a major challenge for U.S. firms that have CE-certified their products
    is to stay current on new standards coming on stream for their products. For example,
    the European standards bodies have developed some 900 standards for the Low Voltage
    Directive and around 185 standards for the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive
    (EMC). Not only are new standards being issued, but these new standards in some
    cases have replaced standards that companies may have met earlier. European customs
    may look for reference numbers of widely-used standards on the Declaration of
    Conformity to assure compliance of products entering Europe. U.S. companies that
    use EMC or low voltage standards that have been replaced are considered to be
    noncompliant with CE marking requirements. Germany is one of the stricter countries
    for enforcing CE marking requirements. In a recent year the European Commission
    brought some 200 cases against companies, many in Asia, for noncompliance with
    the Low Voltage Directive. Some of these cases resulted in bans from the European
    market. U.S. companies and test houses must keep up-to-date on these new standards
    that will force changes in their testing and design plans.

  :question: Under what conditions are U.S. companies unable to self-certify for the
    CE Marking?
  :answer: While manufacturers can self-certify many products under the New Approach
    Directives, certain high-risk products cannot be self-certified. These higher
    risk products require the services of a "notified body" within the European Economic
    Area (EEA). The EEA consists of the EU plus the European Free Trade Association
    countries of Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein, excluding Switzerland. Notified
    bodies are independent testing houses or laboratories authorized by the EU member
    states to perform the conformity assessment tasks specified in the directives.
    A notified body may use a subcontractor to perform part(s) of a conformity assessment
    procedure. Many U.S. testing houses act as subcontractors to the EU notified bodies.
    However, the notified body is the ultimate authority, and a company must gain
    notified body approval in order to claim CE marking compliance for its project.
    For information on how to obtain a list of notified bodies, look at http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/newapproach/nando.
    For a list of U.S. companies that subcontract to EU notified bodies, go to Testing/Certifying
    Labs on this website.

  :question: What have the Europeans done to enforce the CE Marking requirements and
    what are the penalties for non-compliance?
  :answer: 'European national agencies, such as Customs authorities and/or the Departments
    of Health, Industry and Labor, have been appointed to conduct market surveillance
    for CE marking. The purpose of this surveillance is to ensure that the provisions
    of the New Approach Directives have been met for products marketed within the
    European Union. In pursuit of this goal, surveillance authorities will: visit
    commercial, industrial and storage premises on a regular basis; visit work places
    and other premises where products are put into service and used; organize random
    checks; and, take samples of products for examination and testing. The surveillance
    authority can ask for the manufacturer''s declaration of conformity and technical
    file after making a random check. The manufacturer, his authorized representative
    or the importer must be able to provide the technical file within seven to 10
    days after the surveillance authority makes the request. If the product is found
    to be noncompliant, corrective action will depend on and be appropriate to the
    level of noncompliance. The surveillance authority will hold accountable the person
    responsible for affixing the CE marking to the noncompliant product. Others responsible

    which may include imprisonment, are determined by national law.'

  :question: What is the advantage of using European Standards?
  :answer: Products that meet the applicable technical standards developed by the
    three standards organizations are presumed to conform to the requirements of EU
    directives and are allowed to circulate freely within the European Union. Use
    of European standards is seen as a "fast track" for gaining CE marking compliance
    for a product. For many products, though, a manufacturer can choose not to comply
    with the CEN, CENELEC, or ETSI standards, if the firm can demonstrate that its
    product satisfies the essential safety and health requirements of the directives.

  :question: What is the CE Marking, and what is its purpose?
  :answer: The European Commission describes the CE marking (an acronym for the French
    phrase "Conformite Europeenne") as a "passport" that allows manufacturers to circulate
    industrial products freely within the internal market of the EU. The CE marking
    certifies that the products have met EU health, safety and environmental requirements
    that ensure consumer and workplace safety. All manufacturers in the EU and abroad
    must affix the CE marking to those products covered by the "New Approach" directives
    in order to market their products in Europe. Once a product receives the CE marking,
    it can be marketed throughout the EU without having to undergo further product
    modification.

  :question: What is the EU's New Approach to product certification?
  :answer: 'The European Union (EU) developed "New Approach" Directives to streamline
    product approvals for a broad range of goods in order to facilitate trade within
    the EU single internal market. The "Old Approach" Directives contained a high
    degree of technical detail. EU member states introduced national standards or
    regulations at a faster pace than the European Commission could finalize these
    "Old Approach" Directives. These national specifications often proved to be trade
    barriers. New Approach Directives are limited to essential health and safety requirements
    for sectors such as machinery, electrical products, or medical devices. They do
    not cover specific products such as motor vehicles, cosmetics, or chemicals, which
    are still covered under the Old Approach Directives. The main difference between
    the New and Old Approach Directives is that under the New Approach, the technical
    details outlining the minimum requirements a product must meet are usually not
    found in the directive itself. The New Approach Directives are more general. Technical
    details on how to meet these minimum health and safety requirements are left to
    the following three groups: 1) Manufacturers who self-certify products by meeting
    the requirements of the applicable directives, in some cases by using appropriate
    European standards; 2) the three regional European standards organizations (CEN,
    CENELEC and ETSI), which now develop Europe-wide standards covering product sectors
    falling under the New Approach Directives; and, 3) government-appointed product
    certification bodies (called notified bodies), which provide testing and product
    approvals. Under the New Approach, the European Commission gives mandates to the
    European standards organizations to develop technical standards that meet the
    essential health and safety requirements of CE Marking directives. The New Approach
    Directives are designed to facilitate product certification, to maintain a high
    level of consumer and workplace safety, and to expand intra-European trade.'

  :question: What is the significant impact of the radio and telecommunications terminal
    (R&TTE) Directive?
  :answer: 'This directive shows how not only standards but directives can change
    as a result of the CE marking program. The R&TTE Directive (1999/5/EC) went into
    force on April 8, 2000 and replaces the previous directive on telecommunications
    terminal equipment (98/13/EC). The purpose of the new directive is to cover both
    radio and telecommunications terminal equipment. The new R&TTE Directive allows
    manufacturers of telecommunications terminal equipment to self-certify, an option
    they didn''t have in the past, by adhering to the appropriate European standards
    and getting a test result from a qualified laboratory, preferably an EU-affiliate
    lab. (There are EU-affiliate labs in the United States.) Types of equipment for
    which manufacturers can now self-certify include fax machines, phones, modems,
    and digital telecom equipment. Manufacturers of radio communications and wireless
    equipment will still need to get their product certified at an EU-affiliate lab
    authorized by a notified body. Under the U.S.-EU Mutual Recognition Agreement
    (MRA) on telecom, there are now U.S. labs that are certified to do testing and
    certification for the R&TTE Directive. For a list of these labs, consult the website:
    http://ts.nist.gov/mra. Manufacturers who have already complied with the old directive
    (1999/5/EC), and whose product has been put in service will not need to re-certify
    their products, but they will have to take off the old marking, put on the CE
    marking, and be able to back up the CE marking with technical documentation. Manufacturers
    who have products in inventory certified under the old directive will have until
    April 2001 to sell their products. After that, only products certified under the
    R&TTE Directive will be allowed to enter the European market. For more information
    on the R&TTE Directive, consult the website: http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/rtte/index_en.htm.'

  :question: Which product groups are covered by the New Approach Directives?
  :answer: 'The New Approach Directives are listed on the website: www.newapproach.org.
    There are New Approach Directives for electronic and electrical products, machinery,
    medical devices, radio and telecommunications terminal equipment, recreational
    craft, pressure equipment, equipment for use in potentially explosive atmospheres,
    personal protective equipment, toys, simple pressure vessels, and others. A company
    affixes CE marking to its product once the essential health and safety requirements
    of the applicable New Approach Directive(s) have been met. These directives came
    about as a way of eliminating trade barriers and facilitating the EU Single Internal
    Market. Not all products fall under the New Approach Directives. There are essentially
    three levels of regulatory control: Old Approach - The Old Approach Directives
    apply to the foodstuff, motor vehicle, chemical, cosmetic, detergents, biocides,
    and pharmaceutical sectors. These regulations have technical specifications written
    into the annexes. New Approach - These directives make references to harmonized
    standards and apply to broad product sectors such as machinery, electrical and
    electronic products, medical devices, and radio and telecommunications equipment.
    The directives usually set down general health and safety requirements, and the
    specifications for meeting these general requirements are found in the standards
    applicable to the manufacturer''s product. Conformity assessment procedures (the
    system and responsibilities for testing and certification which should lie with
    the manufacturer and, where applicable, accredited test laboratories) are also
    contained in these directives. The General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) covers
    all products not specifically covered by CE marking directives but which do require
    some level of safety regulation. These products may also be regulated at the national
    level by member states. The role of standards in New Approach, Old Approach and
    GPSD: There is a vast body of European standards. Voluntary industry standards
    are known as European harmonized standards whenever they are linked to European
    new approach legislation. European harmonized standards are developed by one of
    three European standards organizations based on a mandate from the European Commission.
    Products meeting the applicable technical standards developed by the European
    standards organizations are presumed to conform to the requirements of EU new
    approach directives and are allowed to circulate freely within the European Union.
    Use of the European harmonized standards is seen as a "fast track" for gaining
    CE marking compliance for a product. For many products, though, a manufacturer
    can choose not to comply with the CEN, CENELEC, or ETSI standards, if the company
    can demonstrate that its product satisfies the essential safety and performance
    requirements of the directives. Old approach legislation may refer to existing
    standards in the text or annexes, thus becoming mandatory. Technical annexes often
    are standards in their own right. As for the general product safety directive,
    safety of products can be demonstrated by using existing standards which have
    been referenced in the Official Journal, the EU equivalent of the U.S. Federal
    Register. These standards cover products such as furniture, household appliances
    (non-electrical), sports equipment, childcare articles, and small hand-held tools.
    The standards define characteristics such as durability, appearance, and quality.'

  :question: Why does the Turkish Customs Authority not accept a Notified Body issued
    Certificate(s) of Conformity?
  :answer: Companies selling to the Turkish market must submit evidence of conformity
    compliance (CE Marking) either by providing a notarized/consularized conformity
    certificate from a notified body or a corporate issued certificate of conformity,
    which declares compliance of all relevant standards and directive annexes. Turkish
    Customs may on occasion question if the certificates are original. In such cases,
    the company may wish to have the Notified Body Certificate of Conformity or the
    corporate issued Certificate of Conformity notarized/consularized to confirm document
    authenticity. For U.S. companies having difficulty in having documents recognized
    for authenticity, the Commercial Attach can assist in having a consular stamp
    affixed to your Certificate of Conformity that would be accepted by the Turkish
    Customs service.
