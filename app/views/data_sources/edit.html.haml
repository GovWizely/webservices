      This is a YAML representation of the mapping from the CSV file to what Elasticsearch will index.
      It also informs how the search API endpoint for
      %b= @data_source.api
      will behave.
    %p
      There are five possibilities for the type field. The parser makes a guess at what the types should be,
      but you can override this.
      %dl
        %dt string
        %dd Freeform text, indexed and searched using the snowball analyzer
        %dt enum
        %dd Controlled vocabulary, used for case-insensitive exact-match filters
        %dt date
        %dd ISO 8601 date (with optional time), used for date range filters
        %dt float
        %dd Floating point number
        %dt integer
        %dd Long integer
    %p
      The
      %b :source:
      field refers to the heading in the CSV document. Do not modify this. If you want to change the name of the field
      that gets used for the API call, change the top level entry for that YAML item. Remember to underscore
      the top level name (e.g. de_minimis_currency), and keep it a singular noun.
    %p
      If you don't want a field returned in the API results, delete the whole YAML entry.
    %p
      If you want fields returned in a different order then they are listed in the CSV file, just rearrange the blocks.
    %p
      If you want a field returned in the API results but not be searchable or filterable, set the
      %b :indexed:
      value to false.
    %p
      If you want a field to be filterable on multiple values (comma-separated), set the
      %b :plurals:
      value to true. Do not pluralize the name of the field.
    %p
      The
      %b :description:
      field is optional, and is just for your own records. You can delete the whole line if you don't want to see it.
