    <content><![CDATA[<p>​​<img alt="U.S. Commercial Service logo" src="http://informationportalprod/Files/U.S.%20Commercial%20Service%20logo.jpg" style="margin:5px;" />​</p><p>To be more competitive in the global economy, the United States must grow its exporter base. Even though exporting is a proven source of growth for both U.S. companies and the U.S. economy, the United States is just beginning to tap its export potential.</p><p>​Approximately 58% of U.S. exporters sell to only one foreign market (source:<a href="http://informationportalprod/Pages/http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/edb/2006/edbrel.pdf">US Census Bureau</a>).</p><p>Exporting accounted for only 12 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007. As compared to other industrialized nations like Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, where exporting accounts for 30 – 49 percent of GDP, the U.S. must do better (source:<a href="http://informationportalprod/Pages/http://www.export.gov/build/groups/public/@eg_main/documents/webcontent/eg_main_020090.pdf">National Export Strategy</a>).</p><h2>What is the Strategic Partnership Program?</h2><p>To broaden and deepen the U.S. exporter base, the U.S. Commercial Service Strategic Partnership Program is leveraging partnerships with trade associations and private corporations. Through these innovative public-private partnerships, we are communicating to millions of U.S. businesses about global business opportunities through the U.S. Commercial Service.</p><p>In doing so, the U.S. Commercial Service Strategic Partnership Program creates triple win scenarios:</p><p></p><ul><li><p>National export objectives are supported;<br></p></li><li><p>Partners deliver valuable information to help their customers and members grow; and<br></p></li><li><p>More small- and medium-sized businesses get the export assistance they need to be successful and maintain good American jobs at wages 13 to 18 percent higher than workers in non-exporting firms​.​</p></li></ul><font color="#000000" face="verdana"></font><table width="100%" class="ms-rteTable-default" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td class="ms-rteTable-default" style="width:50%;"><a href="http://informationportalprod/Pages/http://www.azcommerce.com"><img alt="Arizona Commerce Authority logo" src="http://informationportalprod/Files/Arizona_Commerce_Authority_logo.jpg" style="margin:5px;" /></a></td><td class="ms-rteTable-default" style="width:50%;"><p>The Arizona Commerce Authority (ACA) is the leading economic development organization with a streamlined mission to grow and strengthen Arizona's economy.
