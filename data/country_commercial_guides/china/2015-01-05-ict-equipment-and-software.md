####Overview	

Return to top

The 12th Five-Year Plan (12th FYP), announced in 2011 and covering years 2012-2017, included extensive and specific policy support for many sectors of the ICT industry. These sectors have been designated as Strategic Emerging Industries (SEIs), including "next generation information technology" such as high-performance integrated circuits (IC), cloud computing, and mobile communication networks.

China has designated seven SEIs and plans to spend $1.7 trillion over the course of the FYP in order create a more robust ICT industry that will not only compete on a global scale, but provide new standards for the rest of the world's industries to follow. During the first year of the new 12th FYP, U.S. ICT exports to China decreased. This could be a result of specific Chinese Government policy support for the domestic sector, though more probably because of the sluggish world-wide economy. Total domestic consumption of ICT products (HS codes 8517 through 8548) totaled $317.62 billion. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology estimated the total ICT market size to be $1.48 trillion, which is presumed to include trade in services.

####Best Prospects

#####Semiconductors

The 12th FYP included support incentives for IC and Light Emitting Diode (LED) manufacturers. Most new fabrication plants built in China receive subsidies or other support from local governments, and as a result many foreign companies are establishing fabrication facilities in China. Between 2008 and 2010 foreign companies invested in forty-six percent of new LED fabrication facilities. Possibly because of increased foreign investment into production capacity in China, the US saw a 19.43% drop in the value of semiconductor exports to China in 2011.

China has experienced overall growth in the semiconductor industry, but mostly manufactures low and mid-range semiconductors. Equipment necessary for manufacturing wafers and LEDs are mostly imported from abroad. Increased foreign

investment in wafer and LED fabs in China should increase demand for high-end semiconductor manufacturing technology.

#####Software

China's software industry remains a key focus for the nation's central government, with incentives for both domestic growth and foreign investment. At present, the market remains diverse and highly fragmented, with over 16,000 locally-certified software companies, approximately 40,000 registered software products, and more than one million software-industry professionals. Over the next few years, the industry is expected to experience more consolidation. Overall, China's software industry still lacks core technologies, high-end software development talent, and consistent high quality software products. Moreover, foreign brands enjoy a large market share in the high-end segment of the software market, with local software products comprising less than 30 percent of the market.

Although packaged software imports from the US continue to rise, the best prospects for US firms are for high-end software solutions requiring a certain level of customization. As an indication of the rapidly changing marketplace and delivery methods such as cloud services, the true size of China's software market is unknown. The preceding table includes only packaged units tracked on Global Trade Atlas and UN Comtrade. Other entities, such as MIIT, estimate that China's software market grew to over $290 billion in 2011. Best prospects for 2012 include:

######Application software and specialty software

Solutions pertaining to enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), service-oriented architecture (SOA), middleware, and open-source software will have good prospects in the China market.

######High-end enterprise management systems software

Solutions that address database management systems, systems management software products, and networking security software products remain some of the fastest growing areas for foreign firms selling in the China marketplace.

######Specialty software

Customized software targeted for a specific industry or market sector is a market segment in which foreign firms have an estimated 70 percent of the market. U.S. firms hold a strong position in such areas as firmware, as well as gaming, automation, digital imaging, storage, and security software.
 
#####Cloud Computing

Cloud computing and other cloud services are a recent development in China. China has allocated $103 million dollars to help guide the business-led development plan, led by indigenous companies like Baidu and Alibaba. Considered a SEI, many pilot projects are underway in select cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuxi and Hangzhou. Domestic businesses developing cloud technology in these cities can be expected to receive subsidies. Despite the recent investment, cloud computing isn't expected to be applied on a large scale until the 13th FYP, when the industry will be worth up to an estimated $156 billion. Current figures value China's cloud industry at $9.63 billion. Recent large, private investments by some of China's major mobile carriers further indicate the importance placed on domestic cloud development: China Mobile recently invested $1.9 billion into a cloud datacenter located in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia. China Mobile's goal is to use the center to assist the roll-out of their 4G network and TD-LTE standard. China Unicom and China Telecom have also reportedly invested $1.6 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, within Inner Mongolia.
