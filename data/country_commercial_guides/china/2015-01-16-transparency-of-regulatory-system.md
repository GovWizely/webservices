China's legal and regulatory system is complex and generally lacks consistent enforcement. Foreign investors rank inconsistent and arbitrary regulatory enforcement and lack of transparency among the major problems they face in China's market.

The State Council's Legislative Affairs Office (SCLAO) posts many proposed regulations and many draft rules on its website for public comment, though usually for less than 30 days. Central government ministries and agencies have increased the number of draft trade and economic-related departmental rules made available on their own ministry websites for public comment, but comment periods can be extremely brief and the impact of public comments on final regulations is not clear. Foreign investors report that Chinese regulators at times rely on unpublished internal guidelines that affect their businesses. SCLAO has issued instructions to Chinese agencies to publish all foreign trade and investment related laws, regulations, rules, and policy measures in the MOFCOM Gazette, in accordance with China's WTO accession commitment.
