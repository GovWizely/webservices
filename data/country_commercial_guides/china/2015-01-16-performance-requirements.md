China has committed to eliminate export performance, trade and foreign exchange balancing, and local content requirements in most sectors. China has also committed to enforce only technology transfer rules that do not violate World Trade Organization (WTO) standards on intellectual property and trade-related investment measures.

In practice, however, local officials and some regulators prefer investments that develop favored industries and support the local job market. In addition, Chinese regulators have reportedly pressured foreign firms in some sectors to disclose intellectual property content or license it to competitors, sometimes at below market rates.

Many localities – including special economic zones, development zones and science parks – court foreign investors with packages of reduced income taxes, resource and land use fees, and import/export duties, as well as priority treatment in obtaining basic infrastructure services, streamlined government approvals, and funding support for start-ups. These packages may also stipulate export, local content, technology transfer, or other requirements.
