Time throughout China is set to Beijing time, which is eight hours ahead of GMT/UTC. When it's noon in Beijing it's also noon in far-off Lhasa, Urumqi, and all other parts of the country. However, western China does follow a later work schedule to coincide with daylight hours.

Business Hours

China officially has a five-day work week although some businesses stretch to six days. Offices and government departments are normally open Monday to Friday between 8:30 AM and 5 PM, with some closing for one or two hours in the middle of the day.
