####Overview	

Return to top

China has the world's largest construction market. According to the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD), over the next decade, China will build half of the world's new buildings and is currently adding 2 billion square meters of floor space annually.1

China is set to reduce its energy consumption and made carbon dioxide emissions a "binding goal" in its 12th Five-Year Plan for Economic and Social Development. Many provinces and cities have drafted their own enforcement plans; every city is planning to be an "eco-city" by not only retrofitting old buildings but also by building new low carbon buildings.

####Sub-Sector Best Prospects

Green building products that meet the new energy efficiency standards in new, unique or economically competitive ways have a potential market in China. Some of the best prospects for China's market are:

* Green-design techniques
* HVAC systems
* Solar products
* Grey water, water reuse systems, and landscape materials
* New building materials
* New technologies & products

According to the China Greentech Initiative Report, the following building materials are the target energy efficient products in China.
* Concrete: slag cement and fly ash content; autoclaved aerated concrete
* Insulation: Expanded (EPS) and Extruded Polystyrene (XPS)
* Roofing: Reflective Systems Vegetated Roofs TPO membranes
* Windows and Doors: double-glazed low-solar-gain Low-E Glass
* Lighting: T series light fixtures CFL and LED bulbs
* HVAC: absorption chillers, variable frequency drives (VFD), energy recovery wheels, air purifying equipment
* In door building materials: low-emission, thermal and noise reduction, and insulation
* Integrated design

On December 2010, the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Science and Technology, MOHURD, and the State of Energy Bureau jointly announced government subsidies for solar roofing systems to promote the development of solar products in China. Due to China's geographical structure, heat preservation, insulation, translucence, and ventilation are very important in China's different regions. For example, in northern China, it is imperative to reduce the amount of energy used via heating supply. Improvements to heat preservation in new and old buildings are vital to achieving this goal. New types of energy conservation products, such as wall-structure preservation products, and heat supply measuring systems have been used extensively in these areas.

####Opportunities

According to Liu Zhifeng, Director of China Real Estate Research Committee, in the next decade, China's real estate construction market has great potential due to economic development and urbanization. In the next 10 years, China's urbanization will reach 65-70 percent and the urban resident population will increase by another 300 million. Other than the development of commercial, tourism, senior housing and industrial real estate, China still needs to complete 800 million square meters of residential housing in order to accommodate the urban population. This should take another 10 years. China's 12th FYP indicated that 36 million apartments will be built. China also plans to invest $158.7 billion on "Nation City and Town Sewage Treatment and Renewable Construction Plan."

Within China's 12th FYP for China's Economic and Social Development, many provinces and cities have drafted their own development plans.

For example:

* By the end of 2012, Fujian province plans to invest $152 billion for construction, the government is encouraging them to use new types of wall materials and other emergency efficiency building products.
* Jiangxi province has set up the goal of emergency efficiency: new buildings must reduce the emergency likelihood by 50 percent, while the design standard enforcement should reach 100 percent.
* Guangzhou city has announced that it is mandatory for all government buildings to adapt to green building standards.
* Nanjing city plans to make the "Hexi New City" a sustainable "green energy efficient, and land efficiency project" in time for the "Youth Olympics" in 2014.
* Henan province plans to invest $115 billion on infrastructure and real estate projects.
* Fujian province plans to invest $119 billion in the construction industry by 2020.
* Tibet Autonomous Region plans to invest $174 million on infrastructure and environment.
* Beijing plans to build 100 "Sunny Schools" using solar energy for electricity, water, and heating system.
* Sichuan province: the urban population of Sichuan province will reach 48 percent by 2015.
* In 2012, Hunan Province plans to invest $3.2 billion (RMB 20 billion) into the Daxiangxi area. The purpose is to transform it into an ecological tourism and economic development area.
* Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Fukang city invested $1 billion (RMB 158 million) for city construction.
* According to the "National Airport Allocation Plan," China will upgrade, expand and build 244 airports by the end of 2020. For example: Beijing's second capital airport will be located in Daxing County, Beijing. The airport is expected to be operational by 2015, and will serve 600 million passengers per year.
* Xi'an City will build 3.73 million square meters of affordable housing, and Chongqing city will build 30 million square meters by the year 2013.
* According to MOHURD's Qinghai branch, Qinghai province plans to invest $11.2 billion (RMB 75 billion) in real estate development by 2015.
* By 2015, Nanchang city plans to build 231 key projects, with total investment to reach $23 billion (RMB 155.2 billion). The projects will include fast transportation systems with modern transportation hubs, bio-landscape gardens, and a renewable development demonstration city.
* By 2015, Hubei province plans to build 1,000 eco-demonstration towns and villages. The water supply pipe line will reach 98 percent of the province, the garbage treatment rate will reach 85 percent, and the urbanization rate will reach 52 percent in Hubei province.
* Nanjing city plans to use geo-thermal technology in their buildings, and 60 percent of new buildings plan to include this technology by 2013.
* During the 12th FYP period, Wuhan city plans to invest $2 billion (RMB 13.8 billion) in green landscape projects.
