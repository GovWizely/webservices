The Chinese franchising market is dominated by traditional franchise operations like food and beverage (F&B) and retail outlets. According to CCFA, nearly 40 percent of all franchisers in China are engaged in such industries. U.S. franchisers established a particularly strong foothold in the F&B market.

Franchising opportunities abound in non-F&B industries. The best prospects in this form of franchising include sectors such as car rental and services, budget hotel chains, general business services and fitness.
