The ability to provide adequate after-sales service is an important selling point and can distinguish a company from its competitors. Wholly owned service companies and foreign invested enterprises are now able to provide sales service and after-sales customer support in China. Heightened consumer awareness has given U.S. companies with strong international brands an advantage in the Chinese market, as American products and services are generally considered to have superior sales and customer support standards. This, of course, requires a certain degree of localization, and a commitment to training the local sales and service force.
