In addition to large multinationals, many of which continue to earn impressive returns on their exports to and investments in China's market, American small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are also active here. The U.S. Department of Commerce's Commercial Service (CS) counsels American companies that in order to succeed in China's market, they must thoroughly investigate their specific market, take heed of product standards, and pre-qualify potential business partners. Stumbling blocks that foreign companies often run into while doing business in China can be grouped into the following broad categories.

* China often lacks predictability in its business environment. China's current legal and regulatory system can be opaque, inconsistent, and often arbitrary. Implementation of the law is inconsistent. Lack of effective protection of intellectual property rights is a particularly damaging issue for many American companies. Both those that already operate in China and those that have not yet entered the market have had their product IP stolen by Chinese companies.
* China has a government that, in some sectors of the economy, could be called mercantilist due to the significance of exports in the growth model. China has made significant progress toward a market-oriented economy, but parts of its bureaucracy still seek to protect local firms, especially state-owned enterprises, from imports, while encouraging exports.
* China retains much of the apparatus of a planned economy, with five-year plans setting economic goals, strategies, and targets. The State and the Communist Party directly manage the only legal labor union.
