Much of the demand in the safety and security industry is related to digital technology, security guard communications systems, network technology for inspection control systems, and emergency warning systems.

* Inspection control systems: This will continue to be a high-growth sector. Panasonic, Samsung, Sony, JVC, and Sanyo dominate the market in China's high-grade inspection control market.
* Security guard communication systems: China's domestic enterprises dominate in this sector and foreign enterprises such as U.S. companies BlI and HID, the UK's TDSI, and Israel's DDS occupy the majority of the security guard communications market.
* Emergency warning systems: There is high demand for intelligent airport systems. Foreign companies dominate the market for high-end products, leading the trend towards integrated safety and security systems.
* Detection Equipment: Since China's domestic manufacturers lack capacity to supply the market, foreign products in this field are in high demand.
