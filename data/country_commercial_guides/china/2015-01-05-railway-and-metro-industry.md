#####Railway Industry

During the 11th Five-Year Plan period (2006-2010), China's rail network carried a total of 7.28 billion passengers, and 16.24 billion tons of freight. By the end of 2011, China had a total of 91,000 kilometers of railway, which is utilized to meet freight and passenger demand, ranking second in the world in terms of length. Freight volume reached 3.6 billion tons in 2010, 300 million tons more than in 2009. By the end of 2010, electrified railway mileage reached 42,000 kilometers, becoming the second longest in the world.

China is in the high-speed rail era. Its high-speed rail network reached 8,358 kilometers at the end of 2010 and is expected to exceed 13,000 kilometers by 2012 and 16,000 kilometers by 2015. High-speed railways are incorporated as part of the country's "express railway network," which is expected to reach 45,000 kilometers in length by 2015. The express railway network includes railways of three speeds: arterial rail lines at a speed of 300 km/h, intercity and extension and linking lines at 200-250 km/h, and railways in western China with speeds of 160-200 km/h.

#####Metro Industry

China is now the world's largest market for urban rail transit. By the end of 2010, more than 40 urban rail lines totaling some 1,400 kilometers had been in service in 12 cities on the Chinese mainland, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Wuhan. To date, 36 cities in China have proposals to construct urban rails, of which 28 cities have won official approval. The 28 cities are planning 87 lines exceeding 2,500 kilometers in total by 2015, with a total investment of RMB 1 trillion.

#####Railway Industry Opportunities

The investment scale of the new railway line during 12th Five-Year Plan (12th 5YP) period (2011â€“2015) should reach 30,000 kilometers. By the final phase of the 12th 5YP, the total railway operating mileage is planned to increase from the current 91,000 kilometers to around 120,000 kilometers. 60 percent of lines will be electrified, while 50 percent will be double-track lines. The high speed railway will reach 16,000 kilometers. Railway in the western area could reach 50,000 kilometers. The number of new and renovated railway stations will reach a total of 1,015. At the same time, there will be a large number of advanced technical equipment put into use.

During the 12th 5YP period, the total railway investment is expected to reach RMB 2.8 trillion. Compared with railway new line investment during the 11th 5YP, new line investment during the 12th 5YP period is expected to increase by 87.5 percent, with total investment to increase by 41.4 percent.

It is estimated that by 2020, an additional RMB 2 trillion will be invested, of which approximately RMB 600 billion will be earmarked for development of infrastructure related to passenger-dedicated lines, the coal corridor, western lines, and inter-regional connections. China's total rail network will exceed 120,000 kilometers in length, possibly reaching 150,000 kilometers, and 17,000 kilometers of rail will accommodate double-decker trains. In 2012, total fixed asset investment in railways will reach RMB 500 billion, including RMB 400 billion for construction.


#####Metro Industry Opportunities

In 2011, NDRC approved 13 metro rail lines, including Hefei, Changchun, Dalian, Wuhan and Shenzhen. 2,500 kilometers will be completed during the 12th 5YP period. By 2015, 35 cities in China will have metro; there will be around 158 metro lines in total; and total mileage of Metro in China will reach to around 4,200 kilometers with a total investment of $178 billion. By 2020, China is expected to have 6,100 kilometers of urban rail lines.
