**Relationships**

Personal relationships (_guanxi_ in Chinese) in business are critical. _Guanxi_ is deeply rooted in Chinese culture and a necessary tool for getting things done. In any business transaction, your counterpart will want to know with whom they are dealing before getting in too deeply. It can sometimes take many months to develop these types of relationships. American businesses need to understand this aspect of the business culture and take a patient approach.

Thus, it is important for exporters, importers, and investors to establish and maintain close relationships with their Chinese counterparts and relevant government agencies. It is equally important that American exporters encourage strong personal relationships between their Chinese agents or distributors and the buyers and end-users. A web of strong personal relationships can often help ensure expedited governmental procedures and smoother business development in China.

**Localization**

Though Chinese customers welcome U.S.-made products in general, they still prefer to have localized customer support from a manufacturer, such as on-site training, service centers in China, local representatives, and catalogues and manuals in Chinese. While a rapidly growing percentage of the management work-force in first-tier cities speak English, U.S. exporters should understand the limits of English language proficiency in China and do their utmost to see that all materials are 'user friendly', in other words, in good Chinese. On a similar note, certain modifications must be made to accommodate local tastes, customs and systems.

**Logistics**

U.S. exporters should keep in mind that timely delivery and adequate inventory are crucial to success in the Chinese market. Thus, it is important to consider the capabilities of an agent or distributor. Logistics in China have become easier in recent years with the continuous improvement of highway, air, rail and port infrastructure, and transportation options have increased. Most of the major international logistic companies are now operating in China, although the Chinese Government still imposes some restrictive policies when it comes to providing domestic services.
