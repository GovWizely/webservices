China's marine equipment industry currently lags behind the shipbuilding industry. Equipment that is in high demand includes machinery, key electric-mechanical equipment, communications systems, diesel engine crank-shafts and their key components, high-powered diesel engines, ship superstructures, products that facilitate the deep-sea operation of ocean exploration ships, high-grade steel plates and section bars, and environmentally friendly paint. Other potential prospects for shipbuilding can be seen in markets for coating equipment, computer-aided design software and associated technology for ship design and construction, equipment maintenance, high-tech equipment (such as GPS, navigation and on-board computer systems), cutting and welding technology, and related equipment.

Pleasure boats are one of the best prospects for exporters. China's recreational marine industries are poised to expand rapidly in the coming years. Confident that pleasure boats will become incorporated into the lifestyle of China's growing wealthy class, provincial governments, property developers and boat builders are all investing heavily in this expanding industry, presenting significant opportunities for U.S. exporters of pleasure boats, accessories, marina planning services and construction materials.
