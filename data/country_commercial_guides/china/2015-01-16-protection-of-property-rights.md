The Chinese legal system mediates acquisition and disposition of property. Chinese courts have an inconsistent record in protecting the legal rights of foreigners.

**Tangible Property Rights**

All land in China is owned by the state. Individuals and firms, including foreigners, can own and transfer long-term leases for land, structures, and personal property, subject to many restrictions. China's Property Law stipulates that residential property rights will be automatically renewed while commercial and industrial grants shall be renewed absent a conflicting public interest. A number of foreign investors have seen their land-use rights revoked as neighborhoods are slated by the government for development. Investors report compensation in these cases has been nominal.

China's Securities Law defines debtor and guarantor rights and allows mortgages of certain types of property and other tangible assets, including long-term leases as described above. Foreigners can buy non-performing debt through state-owned asset management firms, but bureaucratic hurdles limit their ability to liquidate assets.

**Intellectual Property Rights**

China acceded to the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty in 2007. China is also a member of the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, the Madrid Trademark Convention, the Universal Copyright Convention, and the Geneva Phonograms Convention, among other conventions.

China has updated many of its laws and regulations to comply with the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property (TRIPS). However, in 2009 a WTO dispute settlement panel found that some aspects of China's IPR regime are inconsistent with its obligations under TRIPS. Industry associations representing software, entertainment, and consumer goods continue to report high levels of piracy in China. Trademark and copyright violations are widespread. During its "Special IPR Campaign" from October 2010 through June 2011, China emphasized criminal prosecutions against IPR violations, particularly in the copyright area. In general, however, criminal penalties for infringement are seldom applied. Administrative sanctions are typically non-transparent and are so weak as to lack a deterrent effect. While litigation awards in recent years have been larger than in previous years, civil sanctions against infringement tend to be of limited effect.

Significant regional differences exist in IPR infringement and enforcement, with some areas showing higher levels of protection of IPR and others apparently offering safe harbors to local counterfeiters and pirates. While many Chinese officials are increasing enforcement efforts, violations also generally continue to outpace enforcement. Lack of coordination among various government agencies also continues to hamper many enforcement efforts. In November 2011, China announced the formation of a permanent, State-Council-led IPR enforcement office to coordinate intellectual property protection at the national level.
