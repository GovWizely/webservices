**Railway Industry**

During the 11th Five-Year Plan period (2006-2010), China's rail network carried a total of 7.28 billion passengers, and 16.24 billion tons of freight. By the end of 2011, China had a total of 91,000 kilometers of railway, which is utilized to meet freight and passenger demand, ranking second in the world in terms of length. Freight volume reached 3.6 billion tons in 2010, 300 million tons more than in 2009. By the end of 2010, electrified railway mileage reached 42,000 kilometers, becoming the second longest in the world.

China is in the high-speed rail era. Its high-speed rail network reached 8,358 kilometers at the end of 2010 and is expected to exceed 13,000 kilometers by 2012 and 16,000 kilometers by 2015. High-speed railways are incorporated as part of the country's "express railway network," which is expected to reach 45,000 kilometers in length by 2015. The express railway network includes railways of three speeds: arterial rail lines at a speed of 300 km/h, intercity and extension and linking lines at 200-250 km/h, and railways in western China with speeds of 160-200 km/h.

**Metro Industry**

China is now the world's largest market for urban rail transit. By the end of 2010, more than 40 urban rail lines totaling some 1,400 kilometers had been in service in 12 cities on the Chinese mainland, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Wuhan. To date, 36 cities in China have proposals to construct urban rails, of which 28 cities have won official approval. The 28 cities are planning 87 lines exceeding 2,500 kilometers in total by 2015, with a total investment of RMB 1 trillion.
