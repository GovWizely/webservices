The PBOC and SAFE regulate the flow of foreign exchange in and out of the country, and set exchange rates through a "managed float" system. This system had been informally suspended in 2008 during the financial crisis, but was reinstituted June 18, 2010. Since then, the RMB has appreciated slightly against the USD. The PBOC authorized SAFE to regulate the inter-bank foreign exchange spot and forward markets. Starting from October 1, 2008, companies must report any overseas payment with a payment term over 90 days from the date shown on the import declaration form to SAFE
—no matter the amount—or they will not be allowed to arrange the overseas payment.

The accumulated reported overpayment amount in one calendar year can't exceed 10 percent of total importation amount of the last year.

On October 30, 2008, SAFE published a notice stipulating that from November 15, 2008, when an enterprise enters into a contract that contains a clause for the pre-payment for purchases, the enterprise must register (with SAFE) the contract within 15 working days after the contract is signed. The enterprise also must register the foreign exchange repayment within 15 days before the remittance. If the contract does not contain a pre-payment clause but a foreign exchange repayment is nevertheless required, the enterprise must register the contract and the foreign exchange prepayment within 15 working days before the remittance. As to the amount of the pre-payment, in principle, the enterprise pre-payment quota cannot exceed 10 percent of the total payment the enterprise has made for importation in the past 12 months. However, enterprises handling large, complete sets of equipment are exempt.

In April 2006, the PBOC made the following announcement regarding the partial adjustment of foreign exchange management policies to facilitate trade and investment:

1. In the case that enterprises open, change, or close foreign exchange accounts used for current account transactions, the administration mode is changed from being based on prior approval to direct processing of the applications by banks in accordance with foreign exchange management requirements and business practices while at the same time filing with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE). In addition, the foreign exchange account limits for current account transactions increased, and enterprises are allowed to purchase foreign exchange in advance to support authentic trade payments.

2. Documents required for sale and purchase of foreign exchange in the service trade are simplified with the examination and approval procedures relaxed.

3. Procedures related to sales of foreign exchange to resident individuals have been further trimmed and the limits on purchase of foreign exchange have been increased. Within such a quota, individuals can purchase foreign exchange from banks by presenting their identity documents and declaring the usage of foreign exchange; banks can sell foreign exchange exceeding the quota to individuals after verifying relevant documents to satisfy their real needs.

4. Expanding domestic banks' overseas foreign exchange investment services on behalf of their clients: Qualified banks are allowed to collect RMB funds of domestic institutions and individuals and convert into foreign exchange under a specified limit to invest in overseas fixed income products.

5. Qualified securities brokers such as fund management companies are allowed to collect self-owned foreign exchange of domestic institutions and individuals and use the funds for overseas portfolio investment including buying stocks.

6. Further expanding overseas securities investment by insurance institutions: Qualified insurance institutions are allowed to purchase foreign exchange for the purpose of investing in overseas fixed-income products and money market instruments. The amount of foreign exchange purchases is subject to a limit proportional to the total asset of an insurance institution.
