China has bilateral investment agreements with over 100 countries, including Austria, the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Thailand and the United Kingdom. China's bilateral investment agreements cover expropriation, arbitration, most-favored-nation treatment, and repatriation of investment proceeds. They are generally regarded as weaker than the investment treaties the United States seeks to negotiate. The United States does not have a bilateral investment agreement with China. The United States and China concluded a bilateral taxation treaty in 1984.
