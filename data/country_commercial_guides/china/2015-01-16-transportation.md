**Taxis**

Metered taxis are plentiful and can be hailed along most main streets, especially near hotels and major sightseeing attractions. Taxis are a convenient and fairly inexpensive means of transport, especially if you have your destination address written in Chinese. Transportation is easily arranged at the front door of the hotel. Concierge desks have cards with the name and address of the hotel in Chinese and can assist with giving instructions to the taxi driver. Avoid taking unregistered black taxis.
