Major international franchise firms have established the following best practices for doing business in China:

* Register the brand in China before entering the China market.
* Find local partners who can help navigate the local business environment.
* Understand the cultural differences and adjust market access strategies accordingly.
* Have an ability and willingness to localize your product if necessary, without changing the core product.
* Minimize the price of the final product and the franchising fee to achieve rapid expansion and mass acceptance.
* Manage government relations by establishing and maintaining solid working relationships with relevant Chinese Government agencies.

Foreign franchise brands are receiving greater interest from second and third-tier market developers. Additionally, we are seeing an increase in F&B companies entering the market as wholly owned enterprises to manage the brand, demonstrate proof-of-concept and create a strong foothold prior to expanding into the franchise model.
