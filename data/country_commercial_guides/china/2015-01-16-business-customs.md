Business/name cards are ubiquitous in Chinese business and will almost always be exchanged upon meeting a stranger in such a context. The card should be held in both hands when offered to the other person: offering it with one hand is considered ill mannered. When receiving a card, use two hands and study it. Acknowledge it with thanks and initiate conversation, when feasible. Use an interpreter, if available, to make sure you are communicating correctly and/or understanding the other person correctly.

Don't miss an opportunity to develop an appropriate new business contact, as relationships, called guanxi in Mandarin, remain very important in China.
