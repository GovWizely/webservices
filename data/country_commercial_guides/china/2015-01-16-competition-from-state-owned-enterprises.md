China's leading SOEs benefit from preferential government policies and practices aimed at developing bigger and stronger national champions. SOEs enjoy administrative monopolies over the most essential economic inputs (hydrocarbons, finance, telecoms, electricity) and considerable power in the markets for others (steel, minerals). SOEs have long enjoyed preferential access to credit. Provincial governments have reportedly used their power to deny operating licenses to persuade reluctant owners to sell out to bigger state-owned suitors.

China has two sovereign wealth funds: The China Investment Corporation (CIC) and SAFE. CIC is overseen by a board of directors and a board of supervisors. SAFE is a government agency that reports directly to the PBOC. The SAFE Administrator serves concurrently as a PBOC Vice-Governor. CIC and SAFE invest a very limited amount of their funds domestically. The funds are required neither to submit their books to independent audit nor to publish annual reports, although CIC issued its first annual report in 2009.
