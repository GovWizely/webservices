Total Market Size = US$26.892 billion 

Data Sources: Sindusfarma 

Total Local Production: US$20.987 billion 

Total Exports: US$1.516 billion 

Total Imports: US$7.421 billion

Imports from U.S.: U$1.335 billion

The Brazilian pharmaceutical industry is comprised of 540 local and international companies established in the country, representing total market value of approximately US$ 27 billion in 2013 and with an annual growth rate of 15%. Brazil is among the five largest pharmaceutical markets in the world in terms of unit sales, and the 8th largest market size. According to Brazil’s Pharmaceutical Industry Syndicate (SINDUSFARMA), Brazilian pharmaceutical product imports in 2013 reached US$7.42 billion, an 8.5 % increase over the previous year's level. US exports account for approximately 18% of Brazilian pharmaceutical imports.

About 80% of pharmaceutical companies operating in Brazil are national. However, they are only responsible for a minority of domestic sales. Foreign firms and their Brazilian subsidiaries, mostly from the United States and Europe, supply 70% of the market. This does not include direct sales to the Government of Brazil (GOB).

Taxes applied to medicines in Brazil are among the highest in the world. The GOB collects over US$ 1 billion in taxes from the pharmaceutical sector. The cascading tax method applied to manufactured goods in Brazil affects several industries, and is one of the most important topics that private industry has raised with the government. However, the process aimed at reducing taxes on pharmaceutical production remains slow and bureaucratic. According to government statements, taxes applied on pharmaceutical products are expected to decrease in order to make drugs more affordable for the population, although this applies primarily to state rather than federal taxes.

_Generic Pharmaceutical Products_

Currently, pharmaceutical patents are granted for a period of 11 years. U.S. firms seeking to enter the Brazilian market should be aware that the local generic drug market is growing rapidly. Generic drugs first entered the Brazilian market in 1999. Currently, generic drugs account for 25.6% of sales. Nearly all generic production is purchased by state public health care systems as part of the government’s program to distribute medicines to the country’s poorest citizens.

###Sub-Sector Best Prospects 

Return to top

Best prospects are related to modern life style, such as contraceptive, erectile dysfunction, cholesterol, weight control, diabetes and other medicines that treat chronic diseases. Nutritional supplements and Phytotherapeutic drugs as well as vitamins are also in high demand by Brazilian consumers.

Major imports of pharmaceutical products, in dollar amount, are classified under Harmonized System Code 30.04 as “Medicines with Cyclosporine A”, “Other Medicines with Heterocyclic Compounds in Doses” and “Other Medicines for Therapeutic Use”.

###Opportunities 

Return to top

Brazil’s pharmaceutical market represents an excellent opportunity for US firms wishing to enter the market. The size of the pharmaceutical market is significant and is expected to grow as the government lowers taxes on these products. Tax decreases will not only increase client sales for current patients, but will also attract new consumers who forego cost prohibitive medications and other treatments due to financial constraints.

Opportunities for US firms to export raw materials to Brazil are abundant. Approximately 85% of the raw materials used in the production of generic drugs in Brazil are imported. In addition, major demand for equipment and services associated with the construction of pharmaceutical manufacturing plants represents another opportunity for US exporters.

Due to the recent expiration of several drug patents, the market for generic drugs will present new opportunities for laboratories. Multinational companies are investing in the acquisition of local laboratories in order to establish a stronger presence in this segment and produce locally. Also, the GOB is stimulating the production of medicines locally to replace imports of drugs for treatment of Alzheimer’s, HIV, cerebral aneurysm, leishmaniasis and malaria.
