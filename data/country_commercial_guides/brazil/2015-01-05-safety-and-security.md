![Chapter 4 - Safety Security Overview](images/chap4-safety-security-overview.png)

Brazil has an extensive and well-developed security market that registered an average annual growth of 10% for the last eight years with annual sales around US$26 billion, which includes private security services. Brazil’s market for electronic security equipment alone totals US$592 million and is expected to more than triple to US$1.8 billion by 2017. Foreign products account for approximately 50% of the electronic security total market share, with U.S. products representing half of these imports. The public and private sectors both have and continue to invest heavily in security equipment related to the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympic Games.

For the past four years, while preparing for the Olympic Games, the state of Rio de Janeiro has been implementing an innovative safety program focused on so-called “UPP,” or Pacification Police Units, marking a radical shift in how Rio deals with violence and drug trafficking in the city’s “favelas” (shantytowns) . According to most statistics, the Pacification program has been positively received and the numbers relating to violence have been decreasing since 2008.

The largest clients in this market are the Government of Brazil (GOB), and financial and commercial institutions. For the Games and future major events, the federal government has created a specific agency under the Ministry of Justice, SESGE, charged with overall security planning and coordination for the World Cup and the Olympics.

At the state level, public security secretariats are promoting investments in the acquisition of new technologies in response to the increasing number of protests across the country. Command and control centers become the brain and the heart of the State Police agencies, which must simultaneously analyze and coordinate responses to ensure the safety of the general public. As in most other industry sectors, to be successful in Brazil foreign manufacturers must either establish themselves within the country or have a local representative. The GOB and private enterprise prefer to contact a local representative to handle all import procedures instead of contacting foreign suppliers directly.

###Sub-Sector Best Prospects 

Return to top

Below are the areas that currently present the best prospects in the Security market:

![Chapter 4 - Safety Security Prospects](images/chap4-safety-security-prospects.png)

The Security Industry Association’s (SIA) online 2012 Brazil Security Market Report indicates the nation’s market for electronic security equipment is expected to be valued at US$1.8 billion by 2017. The current market breaks down as follows:

* Video Surveillance 39.6%
* Access Control 20.8%
* Intrusion Alarms 19.2%
* Fire Detection and Suppression 10.4%
* Electronic Surveillance 10%

Geographically, the market is concentrated in the South and Southeast regions of Brazil, where 63.4% of Security companies and 65.5% of personnel can be found. Outside these regions, other states such as Bahia, Ceará, Pernambuco, Goiás and the Federal District (due to purchases made by the GOB) also deserve some attention.

**Cyber Security**

Approximately 32% of businesses in Brazil claim to have been victims of cybercrime in 2012, the second most common form of economic crime. Brazil´s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) reported total cyber-attacks rose 16.5% to 466 million in 2012. The anti-virus firm Symantec estimates that losses due to cybercrime in Brazil in 2011 totaled R$15.9 billion (currently US$7.2 billion), with more than 28.3 million victims. Computer IT security experts at Norton, in 2011, named Brazil as one of the six countries in the world most affected by cybercrime due to a high incidence of phishing, malware, and “Trojan horse” virus attacks, often targeted at personal banking. Unfortunately, until recently, police efforts to fight cybercrime were complicated because it was not classified as a crime.

However, on November 30, 2012, President Rousseff passed two laws that designate cybercrime as a crime in the Penal Code as determined by (1) access of confidential commercial or private data through hacking or the sale of information obtained in this manner, and (2) the use of a credit card without the owner’s permission. These crimes are punishable by up to five years in prison. The Ministry of Defense is concerned about the risk of cyber-attacks during upcoming mega events such as the 2016 Olympics, and the current Minister of Defense, Celso Amorim, admitted before a public audience that Brazil suffers from fragility in the area of cyber security.

**SESGE**

The federal government has created a specific agency, SESGE, under the Ministry of Justice that is charged with overall security planning and coordination for the World Cup, the Olympics and other major events.

The best resources for information about public security, including announcement of public tenders, can be followed at the below website:

###Opportunities 

Return to top

The **Center of Cybersecurity (CDCiber)** began operating in 2010, was officially inaugurated in 2012, and was created inside of the Brazilian Army by the Ministry of Defense to study cyberspace threats, establish national doctrine on the subject, improve and monitor the means of defense against these threats, including investments in hardware and software, and protect Brazilian cyberspace.

This organization works in collaboration with other government organizations including the president and federal police. The GOB has earmarked R$90 million (US$41 million) for cyber security; however as of July 2012, only R$8 million (US$3.6 million), or 8.9%, has been spent.

The **Special Secretariat of Security for Major Events (SESGE)** has an investment budget of R$1.17 billion (US$578 billion) for equipment that will include command and control centers, training, and security items such as mobile police stations, surveillance equipment and software.

In 2012 and 2013, SESGE announced international tenders for equipment and services such as manned observation platforms, unmanned observation platforms, anti-bomb robots, video-walls, radio communications, media intelligence monitoring, video-monitoring, geo-reference systems and cyber security software.

At the state level, local police agencies through the State Public Security Secretariats are investing in supplementing the acquisitions announced by SESGE. As a result, state fire departments and law enforcement agencies are upgrading their radio communication systems, armored vehicles fleets and video monitoring systems.

As a result of steady reduction of electronic monitoring devices’ prices, the Brazilian Association of Private Security Guards detected an increasing deployment of electronic security and monitoring devices in the field of private security as a way to leverage and support private security companies in providing their service -- in some cases, replacing the presence of a private guard.

Without considering the effectiveness of this market trend, local market experts indicate a potential opportunity in the use of electronic devices in support of local private security companies, especially for those companies that have a good critical mass of customers and could act as "cross selling " dealers of new products and services for their existing clients.

With the growth of the economy and the value of cargo transported, such as pharmaceuticals and electronics, there is increasing demand for armed logistics services.

The use of non-lethal weapons such as stun guns has been growing year by year, showing a market tendency across both the public and private sectors.

**Market Entry**

The largest clients in this market are financial and commercial institutions and the GOB, which supplies the national public security sector. As in most other industry sectors, to be successful in Brazil foreign manufacturers must either establish themselves within the country or have a local representative.

The GOB and the private sector prefer to contact Brazilian representatives and do all the import procedures through them, instead of contacting the foreign suppliers directly. It is also important to have a distributor who can offer after sales and maintenance services, replacement parts, and repairs.

Due to the size of the country, most distributors and systems integrators cover only specific regions. They are usually small to medium-sized companies that lack financial capability to invest heavily in product promotion, technical training, and translation of technical manuals. Therefore, it is often important that a U.S. company provide financial support for some of those activities as part of the terms and conditions of the partnership agreement. U.S. companies who have seen the greatest success in Brazil have worked closely with their agents and distributors, investing heavily in market development, product promotion, and personnel training.

The Brazilian Army, through its Supervisory Board of Controlled Products, exerts the control over activities involving the acquisition, transportation, importation and exportation of small arms and light weapons, ammunition, and other related public security products including non-lethal equipment as well. Prior to exporting any law enforcement related products, our office advises U.S. companies to contact the U.S. Department of Commerce for information regarding products that fall into the Brazilian Army control. 

**Prospective Buyers**

The Brazilian government will invest heavily in high tech equipment to provide adequate security for major events such as the World Cup and the Olympic Games. Technical literature must be translated into Portuguese. Although there are no official regulations and technical standards for electronic security equipment, ABESE issues sector-specific certification called the “Yellow Stamp of Quality”. The certification is issued by ABESE to companies in the electronic security sector, including manufacturers, distributors, and service companies.

During the 2014 World Cup FIFA, through the Safety General Office of the 2014 Organizing Committee, was responsible for private security in the perimeter of private places such as: outer and inner perimeter of indoor stadiums; FIFA /COL offices; teams’ and FIFA members´ hotels; and official training fields. If, for any reason, the security inside a stadium or other place under FIFA's responsibility was not guaranteed by this entity, then public safety authorities took control of these areas.

The 2016 Rio Organizing Olympic Committee will also pay special attention to providing security for the Olympic venues, following the same security policy established by FIFA wherein private companies will be in charge of providing security services in the inner perimeter of the stadiums. The procurement process for the Olympic Games is available for viewing at the Rio 2016 Olympic Committee Website (http://www.rio2016.org/). U.S. Companies interested in participating in the bidding process are required to preregister at the Supplier Portal.
