###Overview 

Return to top

Brazil’s sporting goods and recreational equipment market today is mostly supplied by small to medium sized domestic manufacturers. Imports represent approximately 30% of the market. Imports from the United States, as well as from Europe and Japan, will grow as demand for quality and certified products accelerate. Although at a much smaller scale, imports from Asia may grow rapidly, due to aggressive pricing.

###Sub-Sector Best Prospects 

Return to top

**Summer Olympic Games 2016**

The U.S. Commercial Service believes that the 2016 Summer Olympic Games presents a strong possibility for U.S. exporters of sporting goods equipment and services. The 2016 Rio Olympic Organizing Committee will pay special attention to sustainable development in their procurement announcements. U.S. firms that are not invested in Brazil may still have a strong incentive to bid on these projects, especially firms that have had experience supplying sporting goods or specialized event-related services to previous Olympics or major sports events and can address Brazil’s sustainable development goals within their bids.

The Brazilian Constitution provides that all governmental purchases at Federal, State and Municipal levels should be contracted through public tenders. This is regulated by the Brazilian Bid Law (Law 8,666/1993). The procurement process with a timeline of when specific procurements are to be announced for the Olympic Games was announced by the Organizing Committee in mid-2013 on the Rio 2016 Olympic Committee Website [http://www.rio2016.org/](http://www.rio2016.org/)

The Rio 2016 Olympic Organizing Committee released a supplier registration site, known as the “Supplier Portal”: [http://portaldesuprimentos.rio2016.com/sustentabilidade/](http://portaldesuprimentos.rio2016.com/sustentabilidade/) Foreign and domestic companies can pre-register at this website. The U.S. Commercial Service encourages U.S. companies to pre-register to alert the Committee to their interest in becoming an official supplier. Companies that are pre-registered through the portal will receive information as specific bids are announced.

The majority of requests for proposals will occur between 2014 and 2015. In order to ensure a transparent process, the Supplier Portal will be the only means for foreign and domestic companies to register and receive information about upcoming bid announcements.

**Boats, Sailing and Water Sports**

There is considerable potential for water sports equipment in Brazil. This segment is projected to grow at a rate of 10% over the next three years. Natural conditions such as good weather and the extensive Atlantic coast line (over 5,000 miles long), as well as inland waterways, make this a large market.

The Brazilian boat fleet is comprised of about 30,000 motorboats, and about 5,000 sailboats of over 4.8m (16ft). The estimated total figure for motorboats and sailboats docked in marinas across Brazil is 40,574 and 6,430, respectively. The majority of boats in Brazil are runabouts and yachts, representing 83.64% of the market; while the market share for sailboats is 16.36%. Roughly 60% of motorboats are in the range of 7.9m (26ft), while most craft in marinas range from 6m-7.9m (20ft-26ft). Over 50% of sailboats are up to 7.9m (26ft).

Brazil lacks a strong supply chain of parts and accessories. Electronics used in boats and sailboats, such as radar and GPS, is the most attractive market for U.S. companies. Over 90% of such products are imported from the United States.

The leisure marine infrastructure comprises 480 regulated marinas across Brazil’s five regions, of which 13% have opened in the last seven years. These represent 10% of berthing spaces available in the market. The majority of the marinas are small, most have been in operation for a long time, and some have invested in upgrades to meet growing demand. The Government of Brazil lacks a legal framework to oversee the construction of marinas, while high taxation on imported marine equipment such as travelifts and trailers is seen as a barrier for the development of marinas.

Boatbuilding companies are distributed across the country and focus on the domestic market. There are 120 registered boatbuilding companies manufacturing boats of 4.8m (16ft) or greater. Seventy percent of boatbuilding companies produce motorboats, and 15 percent of them have models ranging from 15m (50ft) and above. Only 13% of Brazilian boatbuilding companies produce sailboats.

Two great potential niches in water sports are surfing and diving. The local industry produces excellent equipment; however, this could prove to be an attractive market for U.S. companies due to superior designs and the prestige of U.S. brand names. Diving is an emerging sport and is increasingly popular among Brazilians as a result of beautiful natural locations where scuba diving is very popular. Tourist locations that offer various beach-related activities are also creating a demand for snorkeling equipment. Other high demand products include jet skis and equipment for windsurfing, water skiing and canoeing.

The water sports market is less-price sensitive than the larger sporting good segments because prospective consumers tend to belong to higher income brackets. These consumers also tend to have more leisure time. This market is expected to increase with the rising number of beach resorts being constructed along the north and northeastern coasts of the country.

ACOBAR - The Brazilian Boat Builders Association is generating interest with its “Venha Navegar” (Come Boating) outreach campaign to attract new boaters.

**Fitness Equipment**

Brazil is Latin America’s fitness industry leader, and currently ranks fourth in the world in terms of revenues. Less than 10% of Brazil’s population exercises regularly, whether at home or in gyms. However, this situation is slowly changing because of concerns about obesity and sedentary lifestyles. Gym membership is gaining greater priority in household budgets, and increasingly seen as a status symbol. Also, employers and health insurers are beginning to worry about employee health as it relates to their work-life balance, quality of life and on-the- job productivity. As a result, companies are purchasing equipment for in-house gyms and encouraging employees to take advantage of subsidized gym membership.

Brazil’s fitness market can be broken down into a number of sub-sectors:

Spas and Hotels - With 10-15% growth projections over the next three years, spas and hotels demonstrate potential for fitness equipment. More tourist spas and hotels are opening throughout Brazil as a response to heightened demand for the 2014 and 2016 major sporting events. In fact, a 6.8% growth in the number of hotels is anticipated for these events.

Fitness Centers / Social Clubs - Intense competition has prompted this segment to improve their facilities and invest substantially in new equipment and activities, especially in gyms, which represent approximately 92% of the total market. It should be noted that some 95% of gyms are locally-owned, signaling growth opportunities for US-based fitness facility companies. Additionally, large franchised gyms, some owned by foreign investors, are increasingly present in Brazil and should not be ignored by U.S. firms, whether in joint-ownership, partnership or franchise partnerships.

Home Market - The home market for exercise equipment has high growth potential. Time constraints, traffic and concern about crime are driving more Brazilians to opt for at-home exercise. This segment is also expanding because newly constructed apartment buildings are expected to offer sporting or exercise facilities as an amenity to attract tenants. U.S. equipment is often favored.

Hospitals - Though this segment has not been very well explored by U.S. companies, the potential for U.S. made treadmills and other specialized physical therapy equipment in health care and rehabilitation facilities may be an option.

Corporate - Multinational corporations are increasing their spending on fitness equipment to improve employee morale and health. These enterprises tend to purchase imported products as they look to purchase the highest quality equipment.

**Safety Equipment**

Participation in extreme sports such as mountain climbing, rock climbing, bicycling, skate boarding, roller skating, parachuting, and hang-gliding is increasingly popular. As a result, more safety equipment is necessary to support this market.

###Opportunities 

Return to top

The best means of entering the Brazilian market is by a tiered distribution channel agreement with a local established partner. Trade fairs are an excellent opportunity to meet potential business associates and should be attended by all who are considering entering the Brazilian sporting goods market. In choosing a partner, it is crucial to bear in mind the ability of the party to perform after- sales service such as maintenance of equipment. Additionally, companies should take into consideration the partner’s capacity for geographic distribution, as well as its ability to offer financing options to potential clients. Other strategies to penetrate the market include identification of an agent. However, these are rarely going to be exclusive, which might pose a conflict of interest.
