###Using an Agent or Distributor 

Return to top

Although some companies import directly from foreign manufacturers without local representation, in most cases the presence of a local agent or distributor is essential. As in other countries, the selection of an agent requires careful consideration. Because of regional economic disparities, varying states of infrastructure, complex inter-state trade and taxation rules, and a host of other issues, it is often difficult to find one distributor that has complete national coverage.

The U.S. Commercial Service strongly recommends that exporters and representatives consult with a Brazilian legal representative before writing or signing an agreement. This will help exporters abide by Brazilian laws, particularly to limit liabilities, protect trademarks, better ensure payments, and define warranty terms. Clauses related to exclusivity, promotional obligations, service and support duties, localization and performance targets, among others, may be included within the agreement.

###Establishing an Office 

Return to top

Investment options in Brazil include either setting up a company in Brazil or acquiring an existing entity. Setting up new companies has become increasingly easier, as the Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade (MDIC) has signaled a desire to simplify the process. According to MDIC, Brazilian authorities have significantly reduced the amount of time required to grant various licenses and registrations over the past few years.

The Central Bank monitors acquisitions of existing companies. Corporations (“sociedades anônimas”) and limited liability companies (“limitadas ”) are relatively easy to form. Brazilian law requires that foreign capital be registered with the Central Bank. Failure to comply may cause serious foreign exchange losses, as well as problems with capital repatriation or profit remittance. More information for potential investors can be found in our Investment Climate section (see #Chapter 6), or through Brazil’s Ministry of External Relations’ web resources.

###Direct Marketing 

Return to top

According to Acton International, a U.S.-based international direct marketing services provider, the Brazilian consumer receives an estimated 9.3 pieces of direct mail every month. Its research has shown that 74% of Brazilian consumers like receiving direct mail. With increased expendable income in the growing middle class, direct marketing is an effective option to include in a company’s marketing communications strategy for Brazil.

Brazil continues to lead Latin America in direct marketing activities due to its large consumer base and growing economy. The Brazilian Association of Direct Marketing (ABEMD) is a self-regulated, non-profit entity representing the direct marketing sector. Its web site provides important information regarding codes of conduct, legislation compliance, and direct marketing service providers.

###Joint Ventures/Licensing 

Return to top

Joint ventures are common in Brazil, particularly as an approach for foreign firms to compete for government contracts or in heavily regulated industries, such as telecommunications and energy. Usually, joint ventures are established through "sociedades anônimas" or "limitadas," which are similar to corporations and limited partnerships, respectively. Licensing agreements are also common in Brazil. For more information see #Chapter 6 “Investment Climate” section. All licensing and technical assistance agreements, including trademark licenses, must be registered with the Brazilian Industrial Property Institute (INPI).

###Selling Financial Services 

Return to top

The largest in South America, Brazil’s banking system is highly developed, efficient, and offers a wide range of financial services. The nation’s financial system regulates banking and financial services as well as insurance, and maintains strict accounting and operational supervision.

Financial services in Brazil, including banking, leasing and insurance services are governed by the Brazilian Constitution, which established the National Financial System (Portuguese acronym SFN). This system, headed by Government of Brazil’s Ministry of Finance, is organized as follows:

_Regulatory Agencies_

_National Monetary Council (CMN)_, an official body whose main functions are to maintain control of the medium of exchange and the circulation of money; to establish directives for exchange policy and dealings in gold; to discipline credit and the provision of guarantees; to regulate the establishment, operation and control of financial institutions; to protect the liquidity and solvency of financial institutions; and to guide the applications of resources so as to promote the orderly development of the country.

_Central Bank (Banco Central do Brasil)_, a federal agency entrusted to execute the policies established by the CMN for the improvement and stability of the National Financial System (SFN). Its functions include control of the money supply, the physical issuance of currency, the regulation and control of financial institutions, the control of foreign capital flow, determining credit policy, managing market liquidity levels, monitoring interest and exchange rates, and maintaining savings at levels compatible with the country’s needs.

_Securities Exchange Commission (CVM)_, which directly regulates the stock exchanges, brokers, distributors, pension funds, mutual funds and leasing companies.

_National Council of Private Insurance (CNSP)_, comprised of the Ministry of Finance, the Superintendence of Private Insurance (SUSEP), the Brazilian Reinsurance Institute (IRB), the Central Bank, representatives of the Ministries of Justice and Planning, and four private insurance companies. The CNSP’s responsibilities include setting insurance policy guidelines and rules; regulating private insurance firm creation, organization, activities and supervision; establishing guidelines of insurance contracts; establishing reinsurance rules; and keeping general accounting and statistical records.

_Superintendence of Private Insurance (SUSEP)_, an independent agency subject to the Ministry of Finance via the CNSP. It monitors the insurance and private pension market through the solvency index; establishes operational risk limits; supervises technical reserves; and regulates open pension funds and insurance brokers.

_Classification of Institutions under SFN Governance_

1. Financial Institutions, Banking and Non-Banking

    - Banking: multiple banks, commercial banks, saving & loan banks, cooperative banks, credit cooperatives 

    - Non-Banking: investment banks, development banks, finance companies, saving & loan companies, mortgage companies 

2. Ancillary Institutions 

    - Security dealers

    - Stockbrokers 

3. Other entities not considered financial institutions, yet subject to CMN and Central Bank supervision 

    - Consortium management, commercial leasing companies, advancement and development agencies, investment funds and companies, savings and loan associations, small business credit companies, factoring companies 

4. Insurance and capitalization companies and private pension funds 

    - These organizations are not considered to be financial institutions and therefore are not part of the SFN; however, the CMN has authority to regulate their investment portfolios.

_Brazil’s Largest Banks Ranked by Assets, Public and Private_

Growth results in 2013 by Brazilian banks show the country’s two private banks, Bradesco and Itaú, among the most profitable in Latin America.

![Chapter 3 - Bank](images/chap3-bank.png)

Banco do Brasil, Caixa Econômica Federal (Federal Savings Bank), and BNDES, the National Bank for Economic and Social Development are owned by the federal government. Itaú and Bradesco are Brazilian-owned private banks. Santander is Spanish-owned.

_Market Trends_

According to a survey held by the Brazilian Bank Federation (Febraban), the banking industry is not too optimistic about 2014. Projections indicate that growth of credit operations will remain steady. For individuals, a 10% growth rate is expected, while total portfolios are expected to grow at a rate of 12%. 

_U.S. Participation_

U.S. commercial and investment banking interests have been in Brazil since 1915. In terms of assets, Citibank and JP Morgan were among the top 50 institutions in the country as of December 2013. At that time, the banks held assets of, respectively, US$26.4 and US$14 billion.

###Selling Franchises 

Return to top

Brazil’s franchise sector is among the largest and most sophisticated in terms of business practices and growth, adapting concepts from both foreign and domestic franchisors. The sector has consistently grown faster than the overall Brazilian economy and has become one of its main growth engines. Today, even traditional retail companies are introducing franchising into their expansion strategy. The strength of Brazil’s local franchise concepts poses special challenges for U.S. entities who wish to enter this robust market, more so than what they might encounter in other Latin American markets. However, Brazil’s current market size and future growth forecast of the nation’s economy, notably its internal consumption rate, point to open doors, and place Brazil on many U.S. franchisors’’ lists of expansion markets.

In 2013, the Brazilian franchise sector grew by 11.9 percent, and total sector revenue was about R$115 billion (US$52 billion). There are an estimated 2,703 franchising chains and 114,409 franchising units in the country, making Brazil the sixth-largest in the world (in number of units) and the 3rd largest in number of franchise chains. In the last year, 277 franchisors reportedly entered the market The number of chains grew from 2,426 in 2012 to 2,703 in 2013 (+11.4%), surpassing the American market, in total number of franchise model brands sold, which in 2013 accounted for 2,500 brands. In fact, the United States currently ranks 4th worldwide.

According to the World Franchise Council, Brazil ranks third in number of brands behind China (4,000) and South Korea (3,034). For 2014, the Brazilian Association of Franchising (ABF) projects a further increase of 10%, driven greatly by the opening of new shopping centers around the country, many catering to upper middle class consumers; and the overall forecasted growth of Brazil’s economy.

The best-performing franchise sector in Brazil in 2013 was in sport, health, beauty and leisure products and services, which grew 23.9%. This was followed by the hotel/hospitality industry, which had an increase of 21.9%. The slowest-moving sectors in terms of growth were found in such retail and b-2-b concepts as Gasoline Stations, Supermarkets, Convenience Stores, Logistics and Transportation, Financial Services, Bookstores, Pet Shops, and Catalogue Sales. The discontinuation of some consumer-facing retail services such as photography/film processing and video rental stores is partially to blame for the downturn.

Local Brazilian franchises dominate the market across many sectors, controlling 92.4% of sales volume; while foreign groups, mostly from the U.S., are making headway. According to ABF, 206 foreign franchise brand concepts currently operate in Brazil, of which 93 are based in the U.S.

_Top Players Ranked by Revenue, Number of Units_

The ranking of the top ten franchise operations in Brazil, both by revenue and number of units, shows the dominance of Brazilian franchisors over foreign ones. Only four out of the top 10 performing franchise brands (in terms of earnings revenue and number of units in operating) are foreign: McDonald’s, Subway and AM-PM Mini Market from the US; and Kumon from Japan.

![Chapter 3 - Rankings](images/chap3-rankings.png)

Finding suitable master franchisees in Brazil is a very challenging job for US franchisor companies. One strategy is to develop relationships with Brazilian franchisors and master franchisees of non-competing, yet complementary concepts. In general, Brazilian investors make decisions based on well-structured business plans and the expectations of financial return. It is misleading to think that emotional factors will heavily influence a decision in favor of a certain brand or business concept. It is important that foreign franchisors understand this, and approach the market only after having done the necessary homework, having estimated the true potential of the brand for Brazil.

It is also increasingly common for a Brazilian investor to negotiate risk -sharing agreements with the foreign franchisor when introducing a new brand to the market. “Risk” in this case refers to making actual direct investment in the form of a joint-venture partnership. Also, as many Brazilian concepts are now seeking to expand internationally, some will be open to discussing bilateral agreements, wherein a foreign brand is launched in Brazil at the same time as the foreign franchisor develops a Brazilian brand in its home country. According to ABF, 121 Brazilian brands are present in 60 countries in all continents.

###Selling Professional Services 

Return to top

According to the Annual Survey of Services (Pesquisa Annual de Serviços - PAS), published by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), the service sector is one of the major contributors to Brazil’s economic growth, accounting for over 75 % of formal employment in the country and 68.5 % of its gross domestic product. Worldwide, revenue from services reaches 80 % of the GDP of most developed countries. The sector’s health is so imperative that even financial difficulties in the recent 2008-2012 period did not shake its foundations …in fact the drop in Brazilian exports of services during the crisis was lower than that of manufactured goods.

In 2013, services sector revenues closed the year with a nominal growth of 8.5 %, vs. 2012, when the sector grew 10%. For 2014, the unknown factor for this sector is how the labor market will behave facing three consecutive years of low GDP growth.

U.S. Trade Surplus in Professional Services The United States has benefited from a historic trade surplus in sales of services to Brazil, realizing high rates of growth during the last 12 years, and weathering the 2008-2010 economic downturns.

![Chapter 3 - Trade](images/chap3-trade.png)

_Notable Sectors_

The segments of transportation, auxiliary services and postal services (railway/subway transport, road transport, waterway transport, air transport ancillary services and mail services that in Brazil are called Correios) showed the highest growth in the period, with an increase of 10.8% vs. 2012. The postal and courier services had tremendous growth due to the increase of online shopping by consumers and businesses. All purchases of small and medium size goods in Brazil are delivered via the government’s postal services.

Another segment that stood out in 2013 is hospitality services provided to families, such as lodging, food services, recreational/cultural services and personal services, which increased by 10.2 %. The remaining segments analyzed by the Annual Survey of Services also showed growth: professional, administrative and ancillary services (8.1%), information and communication services (6.9%) and other services (5.9%).

Growth by Region Among Brazil’s 27 states, the highest increases in sales of professional services in 2013 were observed in Mato Grosso (20.4 %), the Federal District-Brasília (15.7%), Ceará (13%) and Tocantins (13 %).

###Selling Retail Concepts 

Return to top

The importance of retail in Brazil is increasingly acknowledged for its role in fueling the Brazilian economic engine. Besides generating the greatest number of formal jobs, since 2010 the retail sector has marked significant growth with consistent indicators of modernization, even during the financial crisis of 2008-09. Since 2004, Brazil’s retail sector has grown by 106%, outpacing the 44% growth rate of the country’s GDP during the same period.

In 2013, Brazil’s domestic retail market was estimated to be worth about $230 billion. Besides the country’s 40% growth in GDP per capita during the last eight years, distribution of population in urban areas also plays a vital role in encouraging the growth of retail sectors. About 30% of the country’s 201 million citizens lives in 10 principal metropolitan cities, led by greater São Paulo with a population of 18 million and Rio de Janeiro with some 10 million inhabitants.

Competitiveness, diverse industrial sectors in the economy, and the growing middle-class consumer population are all factors in such a profound increase in the Brazilian retail market, which was responsible for the creation of 3.7 million formal jobs over the past 10 years. Despite this outsized growth rate, the share of retail as a percentage of the nation’s GDP is still just 26 %. Therefore, there is still much room to grow.

In 2013, the retail sector rate of growth decelerated to just 4.3%, according to data released by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). This was the worst annual growth since 2003, during which sector sales decreased by 3.7%.The results of 2013 were half that of 2012, when sales volume grew 8.5%, led by an 8.5% increase from the supermarket sub-sector (“hypermarkets”). In 2013, hypermarket sales did grow, albeit at a much lower pace; driven by demand for articles for personal and domestic/household use.

**Sectors**

Among all retail segments analyzed by IBGE, the one with the greatest contribution to annual income for the sector was the "other articles of personal and domestic use" division. This catch-all category encompasses segments such as department stores, eyewear outlets, and specialty stores selling jewelry, sporting goods and toys. The increase in income derived from this segment was 10.3% over 2012 figures - the largest increase since 2008. Within this segment, department stores performed most notably.

The “pharmaceutical, medical, orthopedic and cosmetics” segment also contributed strong results in 2013, gaining 10.1% growth, the third highest impact (15%) registered among all retail sectors.

Retail revenue derived from gasoline filling stations, including those offering related automobile maintenance services increased 6.3% increase in 2013 over 2012; while retailers of furniture and white good appliances realized an increase of 5%.

Retail sales of textiles, apparel and footwear increased 3.5% - same as 2012 - and equipment and office supplies, computer and communication advanced 7.2%. The segment of books, newspapers, magazines and stationery was responsible for a minor contribution to the overall rate, registering growth of 2.6% over 2012.

![Chapter 3 - Sectors](images/chap3-sectors.png)

**Looking Ahead**

Brazil expects major consolidation of existing retail leaders as well as entry of foreign brands, which will greatly alter the competitive landscape. In this scenario, the relevance and purpose of brand differentiation and its application in a consistent manner in the online shopping experience, and the multiple formats of physical stores, are the most important factors to be followed by retail brands, in order to ensure successful entry and expansion.

###Selling to the Government 

Return to top

The Government of Brazil (GOB) is the nation’s largest buyer of goods and services. However, winning contracts with the government can be challenging. U.S. exporters may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage if they do not have a significant in-country presence – whether via established partnerships with Brazilian entities or some type of company subsidiary -- as well as the patience and financial resources to respond to legal challenges and bureaucratic delays. To be considered a local firm, that firm’s capital, decision-making authority, and operational control must be majority Brazilian-owned. Since the open period for bidding is often as short as one month, it is advisable to have a resident partner in Brazil.

Government procurement policies apply to purchases by government entities and “parastatal” companies such as Petrobras (i.e., quasi-governmental organization, corporation, business, or agency). Government procurement regulations contained in Bid Law 8666 establish an open and competitive process for major government procurements. Under this law, price is the overriding factor when selecting suppliers. Tenders are open for international competition, whether through direct bidding, consortia or imports. However, for many of the larger tenders (e.g. military purchases), single source procurements are possible if they are deemed to meet the national interest or provide unique technical requirements. In case of a bid tie, nationally owned companies will likely gain preference over foreign competitors. Recent measures are focused on modernizing the federal government’s tender process.

The Brazilian Constitution requires that all government purchases, whether at the federal, state or municipal levels, be contracted through public tenders. This process is regulated by Bid Law 8666, introduced in 1993. This law requires any and all official bidders to have a legal presence in Brazil. Law 8666 establishes general requirements for tenders and administrative contracts for goods and services at the Federal, State, and Municipal levels.

Brazil is not a signatory to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement, which precludes discrimination against goods and services from other signatory countries. Preferences for locally-produced products apply to government procurement at all levels, including federal, state and local. Federal and state tax exemptions were issued specifically for 2014 World Cup, and GOB also suspended some remedy actions on products that will be used during the games. Even with such exemptions now enacted, U.S. companies may find it difficult to participate in Brazil’s public sector procurement, unless they are associated with a local firm that can keep them informed of new procurements on short notice and that can assist with the preparation of required paperwork.

It is important to mention the Basic Production Program (PPB), which is an incentive program of the Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Development, Industry in Foreign Trade for ICT products implemented in 1991. The program gives tax incentives to manufacture or assemble specific products within Free Trade Zones. PPB is well utilized by companies manufacturing cell phones and computers.

In 2010, then-President Lula signed a provisional measure that later was approved by the Congress and became law (No. 12,349, December 15, 2010), giving preference in public tenders to firms that produce in Brazil -- whether foreign-owned or Brazilian – and that fulfill certain economic stimulus requirements such as generating employment or contributing to technological development, even when their bids are up to 25 percent more expensive than competing, imported products. In August 2011, this system of preferences was folded into Plano Brasil Maior , the national industrial policy. Government procurement is just one of thirty-five components under Brasil Maior intended to support Brazilian exporters and protect domestic producers, particularly labor-intensive sectors threatened by exports from abroad. The textile, clothing and footwear industries – among the few industries to have lost jobs during the current growth period – were the first to benefit from Plano Brasil Maior when, in November 2011, the federal government’s Ministry of Development, Industry and Commerce (MDIC) implemented an 8 percent preference margin for Brazilian-made goods in these industries for those suppliers who bid on applicable government contracts. In April 2012, the government added pharmaceuticals and certain heavy construction equipment to the list of products receiving preference. In June 2012, the defense, education, and agriculture sectors also received preference margins. In 2012, US$4.2 billion was earmarked for government purchases of domestically-made products. Special legislation was also enacted for the purchase of local trucks, vans, and roads. In 2013, drills and ICT products received additional preference margins.

In order to stimulate innovation of national products, public institutions (when evaluating bids) can add margins of preference, which apply to the innovative component of a product developed in country and create a cost advantage for the domestic firm. The margins of preference of those products can reach up to 25 percent. Decree 7546/2011 established the requirements to obtain a national product designation, and the measures of industrial, commercial and technological compensation with the goal to strengthen the production of goods in country and technology development. In 2013, the Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade established the requirements for industrial and technological verifications for the additional margins of preference.

Decree 7174 (2010), which regulates the procurement of information technology goods and services, requires federal agencies and parastatal entities to give preferential treatment to locally produced computer products and goods or services with technology developed in Brazil, based upon a complex, price/technology matrix. However, Brazil permits foreign companies that have established legal entities in Brazil to compete for procurement-related contracts funded by multilateral development bank loans. In February 2013, Decree 7903 (2013) was issued, setting new preference margins for ICT products. Under the new guidelines, ICT products assembled in Brazil with imported component parts will have a 15% preference margin, while ICT products manufactured in Brazilian from local components will have a 25% preference.

The preference margins stipulated under Plano Brazil Maior are temporary and are set to expire between 2014 and 2015, depending on the sector. Government procurement is just one of thirty-five components under Plano Brazil Maior intended to support Brazilian exporters and protect domestic producers, particularly in the labor-intensive sectors.

Brazil is negotiating a treaty on government purchases under MERCOSUL, the Southern Common Market, comprised of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela, which promotes free trade of goods, services, and production inputs. When the treaty is signed and ratified, Mercosul-produced goods will also be included in GOB preference margins on public purchases.

A Brazilian state enterprise is permitted to subcontract services to a foreign firm if domestic expertise is unavailable, while a foreign firm may only bid to provide technical services when there are no qualified Brazilian firms.

Including Brazilian goods and services in your company's bid, or subcontracting with a Brazilian firm, may improve your company’s chance for success. Similarly, a financing proposal that includes credit for the purchase of local goods and services for the project will be more attractive. Advance descriptions of U.S. suppliers' capabilities can prove influential in winning a contract, even when they are provided before the exact terms of an investment plan are defined or the project's specifications are fully defined. Such a proposal should include presentations on financing, engineering, equipment capabilities, training, and after-sale service that will originate and be carried out within Brazil.

###Distribution and Sales Channels 

Return to top

All of the customary import channels exist in Brazil: agents, distributors, import houses, trading companies, subsidiaries and branches of foreign firms, among others. Brazilian importers generally do not maintain inventory of capital equipment, spare parts, or raw materials, partly because of high import and storage costs. Recently, because of the creation of additional bonded warehouses, industries that rely heavily on imported components and parts are maintaining larger inventories in these warehouses.

###Selling Factors/Techniques 

Return to top

Price and payment terms are extremely important sales factors. Generally, U.S. goods are perceived as high quality; however, depending on quality as the primary competitive advantage may be risky. To be competitive, U.S. companies should adapt their products to local technical requirements and culture. In some sectors, competing with an ever increasing amount of Chinese imports can be difficult because of their low prices. Therefore, emphasizing product quality, customer service, after-sale service, financing arrangements, and warranty terms are key competitive advantages for U.S. companies. As Brazilian companies become more concerned with environmental stewardship, it is also advisable to demonstrate commitment to sustainable development practices when introducing new products into this market.

###Electronic Commerce 

Return to top

According to the Brazilian Chamber of Electronic Commerce report, the e- commerce segment ended 2013 with US$12.5 billion in earnings, an increase of 28% as compared to 2012. A total of 88.3 million orders were placed in 2013, a 32% increase compared to the previous year. Throughout the year, 9.1 million people made their first online purchase, and the number of consumers that have already made at least one purchase on the internet reached 51.3 million.

The popularization of mobile broadband is another key growth factor. Cheaper smartphones have connected people from the lower to lower–middle (“C” and “D” socio-economic classes) to the Internet, thus allowing these consumers to also buy online.

![Chapter 3 - Electronic](images/chap3-electronic.png)

The most profitable industry sectors for online shopping include electronic appliances, computers, electronics, and fashion and accessories. Fashion is a particularly interesting category, despite the widely held belief that Brazilians need to try on clothes before purchasing. Brazilians tend to purchase through marketplaces and group buying websites. Brazilians also like to take advantage of online discount websites and coupons. Many middle-class consumers are aware that online prices for consumer goods and customer service policies are better than in stores.

Currently, the most popular online retail websites include (in alphabetical order):

* Casas Bahia [www.casasbahia.com.br](www.casasbahia.com.br)

* Lojas Americanas [www.lojasamericanas.com.br](www.lojasamericanas.com.br)

* Magazine Luiza [www.magazineluiza.com.br](www.magazineluiza.com.br)

* Mercado Livre [www.mercadolivre.com.br](www.mercadolivre.com.br)

* Netshoes [www.netshoes.com.br](www.netshoes.com.br)

![Chapter 3 - Sold](images/chap3-sold.png)

The group buying segment also increased 10% as compared to the previous year. M-Commerce (mobile) transactions are also on the rise, reaching 4.2% of total transactions. Amazon, Google, Yahoo and other U.S. giant companies already have offices in Brazil.

_Trends_ 

**Mobility** is one of the strongest trends for 2014, contributing to the M-Commerce rise. Consumers are learning to compare prices and information products via Internet and often prefer the convenience of purchasing items via e-commerce.

**Business-to-consumer** (B2C) e-commerce segment in Brazil accounted for US$12.5 billion in 2013. One factor enabling the development of this sector is the “long-tail” effect, which allows a wider product offering in niche areas compared to that found in physical storefronts. Surveys held in other countries, for example, indicate that online stores’ inventories are 6 to 23 times larger than those of physical stores. Online retailers are taking advantage of U.S. selling techniques. For example, in 2013 in Brazil, Black Friday generated retail sales of $335 million on a single day breaking all the previous records.

U.S. B2C firms seeking to reach the online Brazilian consumer from their U.S. bases should proceed with caution. It is cost prohibitive and unreliable for online shoppers to purchase and import products into the country from the U.S. because of high import taxes. Direct sales from the U.S. are subject to customs and duties regulations. Although Brazil has made substantial progress in reducing traditional border trade barriers (tariffs, import licensing, etc.), rates in many areas remain high and continue to favor locally produced products.

**Geography** plays a major role when evaluating the country’s potential. Consumers in the state of São Paulo account for one-third of online purchases (34.2%), which reflects Brazil’s concentration of wealth and education. U.S. firms should take this concentration into account when assessing potential partnerships and working with consultants and online service providers. Many of the major consulting firms are based in São Paulo, the country’s business capital.

**Payment methods** are complex and varied in nature. Most Brazilians still use cash, checks and payment slips, but the potential for electronic payment methods is huge. According to a survey conducted by Brazilian Association of Credit Card and Service Companies (ABECS) (Associação Brasileira das Empresas de Cartões de Créditos e Serviços), only 27% of the country’s payments are made via credit, debit or prepaid cards. Security continues to be a concern, with relatively little information available regarding online fraud. According to Forbes, Brazil suffers from weak legislation against cybercrimes.

**International transactions** can be challenging for residents and visitors alike. While visitors have relatively few problems using credit cards at hotels and tourist venues, the same is not true for online purchases. Those wishing to pay for services such as airline or movie tickets online encounter barriers, as many Brazilian websites do not accommodate international credit cards. The U.S. Commercial Service has seen some improvements, perhaps spurred by the anticipated large number of international visitors coming to Brazil for major sporting events in 2014 and 2016. Brazilian merchants are increasingly aware of the need to partner with banks and payment providers that can enable foreigners to securely purchase from local websites. U.S. firms providing e-commerce solutions to meet these needs may thus find good opportunities in Brazil.

**Travel and tourism** services purchased digitally within Brazil play an important role in the growth of e-commerce. E-market analysts estimate that travel represented close to a third of the country’s total e- commerce sales in 2013. Brazil’s sheer size means that air travel is required to get from place to place, and airline tickets can be expensive.

**Brazil’s expanding middle class**, especially those at the upper end, will drive growth in e-commerce here. E-commerce sales will continue to come from wealthier buyers, who have more expendable income and more experience in online shopping.

**Tariffs**, in general, are the primary instrument in Brazil for regulating imports. All tariffs are ad valorem, with rates between 0 and 35%, levied on the Cost Insurance Freight (CIF) value of the import, with the exception of some telecommunication goods. Brazil maintains a higher average tariff on processed items than for semi-processed goods and raw materials. The United States continues to encourage tariff reductions on products of interest to US firms. In addition, relatively few Brazilians are comfortable navigating English language websites.

Given the market size and potential, U.S. retailers are encouraged to explore strategies that include a local presence in the market.

###Trade Promotion and Advertising 

Return to top

With its well-established and diversified industrial sector, Brazil has a variety of specialized publications that can provide excellent advertising outlets that target a multitude of trade and consumer audiences. TV advertising can be an especially important marketing channel for Brazil’s growing consumer base. The top advertising categories by expenditure are trade and commerce, consumer services, culture, leisure, sports and tourism, media, and public and social services.

The most popular magazine in Brazil, with a circulation of over one million copies, is the weekly Veja, published by the Abril Publishing Company. The nation’s largest daily circulation newspaper is Folha de São Paulo, published by the Folha Group, with a circulation of 400,000 on Sundays and a daily circulation of 317,000 from Monday through Saturday.

Trade fairs are another important marketing tool. The city of São Paulo hosts around 300 trade fairs per year. Other principal cities host significant shows as well: Rio de Janeiro for the oil and gas industry, and Belo Horizonte for mining. These events attract many visitors and exhibitors from Brazil and foreign countries. Specialists from the U.S. Commercial Service Brazil participate in many of these events, and can help you arrange meetings with potential agents, distributors, lawyers, and customers at these trade shows. Some of the most important trade shows in Brazil are listed by industry in various sections of #Chapter 4.

###Pricing 

Return to top

Payment terms are extremely important in Brazil because of the country’s high interest rates. In fact, it is not unusual for a local company to select a U.S. supplier with higher prices but better financing terms.

In Brazil, all import-related costs are generally high because of import duties and taxes – thus some U.S. companies implement efficient logistics systems even at the risk of lowering profit margins. Further information on a sector-by-sector basis may be found within various sections of #Chapter 4.

###Sales Service/Customer Support 

Return to top

The “Consumer Protection Law” of 1992 mandates customer support and after-sale servicing. In the case of imported products, the importer or local channel partner of record is responsible for such services; therefore, U.S. manufacturers should appoint agents or distributors who are qualified to provide such services.

###Protecting Your Intellectual Property 

Return to top

Several general principles are important for effective management of intellectual property (“IP”) rights in Brazil. First, it is important to have an overall strategy to protect your IP. Second, IP is protected differently in Brazil than in the U.S. Third, rights must be registered and enforced in Brazil, under local laws. Your U.S. trademark and patent registrations will not protect you in Brazil. There is no such thing as an “international copyright” that will automatically protect an author’s writings throughout the entire world. Protection against unauthorized use in a particular country depends, basically, on the national laws of that country. However, most countries do offer copyright protection to foreign works under certain conditions, and these conditions have been greatly simplified by international copyright treaties and conventions.

Registration of patents and trademarks is on a first-in-time, first-in-right basis, so you should consider applying for trademark and patent protection even before selling your products or services in the Brazilian market. It is vital that companies understand that intellectual property is primarily a private right and that the US government generally cannot enforce rights for private individuals in Brazil. It is the responsibility of the rights' holders to register, protect, and enforce their rights where relevant, retaining their own counsel and advisors. Companies may wish to seek advice from local attorneys or IP consultants who are experts in Brazilian law. The U.S. Commercial Service in Brazil can provide a list of local lawyers upon request.

While the U.S. Government stands ready to assist, there is little we can do if the rights holders have not taken such fundamental steps necessary to securing and enforcing their IP in a timely fashion. Moreover, in many countries, rights holders who delay enforcing their rights with the mistaken belief that the USG can provide a political resolution to a legal problem may find that their rights have been eroded or abrogated due to legal doctrines such as statutes of limitations, laches, estoppel, or unreasonable delay in prosecuting a law suit. In no instance should U.S. Government advice be seen as a substitute for the obligation of a rights holder to promptly pursue its case.

It is always advisable to conduct due diligence on potential partners. Negotiate from the position of your partner and give your partner clear incentives to honor the contract. A good partner is an important ally in protecting IP rights. Consider carefully, however, whether to permit your partner to register your IP rights on your behalf. Doing so may create a risk that your partner will list itself as the IP owner and fail to transfer the rights should the partnership end. Keep an eye on your cost structure and reduce the margins (and the incentive) of such would-be bad actors””. Projects and sales in Brazil require constant attention. Work with legal counsel familiar with Brazil laws to create a solid contract that includes non-compete clauses, and confidentiality/non-disclosure provisions.

It is also recommended that small and medium-size companies understand the importance of working together with trade associations and organizations to support efforts to protect IP and stop counterfeiting. There are a number of these organizations, both Brazil- and U.S.-based. These include:

###Performing Due Diligence

It is always advisable to conduct due diligence on potential partners. Negotiate from the position of your partner and give your partner clear incentives to honor the contract. As stated in the previous section, a good partner is an important ally in protecting IP rights. Consider carefully, however, whether to permit your partner to register your IP rights on your behalf. Doing so may create a risk that your partner will list itself as the IP owner and fail to transfer the rights should the partnership end.

Closely monitor your cost structure and reduce the margins (and the incentive) of potential bad actors. Projects and sales in Brazil require constant attention.
