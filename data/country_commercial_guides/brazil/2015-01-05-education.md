###Overview 

Return to top

The education sector in Brazil is ranked as the 10th largest sector in the economy, and generates about US$75 billion per year. Brazil has 51 million students in the basic education system (which includes pre-school, elementary and high school), and around 6 million students are enrolled in university courses. Approximately 75% of graduate students go to private institutions, generating US$12.5 billion per year. In 2015, 10 million students will be in universities, many of whom will be supported by Federal Government loans. With the Government of Brazil (GOB)’s “FIES” loans, students finance up to 100% of their education, while with “PROUNI” loans, public school students finance up to 50%.

The education sector is one of President Rousseff’s highest priorities. Brazil, a vast country with continental dimensions, faces many challenges and needs to deliver a high standard of education for its population so that the country can continue on its growth trajectory. For that reason, the GOB is investing in a wide range of educational programs.

The government's Scientific Mobility Program (formerly called “Science without Borders”), will provide 101,000 scholarships to undergraduate and graduate students from Brazil for one year of study at colleges and universities in the United States and other foreign countries. The program’s specific focus is on promoting scientific research, increasing international cooperation in science and technology and initiating and engaging students in a global dialogue through international education.

The education sector has grown exponentially in recent years in Brazil, and industry specialists project that growth will continue in the coming years, driven by a stabilizing economy and the growing middle class. In the past five years, 26.1 million Brazilians have risen from poverty and this newly emerging class is eager for training, higher education, and vocational courses.

The Ministry of Education’s budget for 2013 is 5.5% of Brazil’s GDP, or US$19 billion. The Ministry seeks to invest heavily in classroom infrastructure, learning technologies, textbooks, and other programs.

Beyond government purchases, the education sector in Brazil (including school supplies, materials and other goods and services related to education) is a US$4 billion industry, wherein lies many opportunities for U.S. companies. School materials comprise 44% of the total value of the education industry in Brazil. University books comprise 18%, basic education books 20%, and alternative educational systems 9%. Franchises for language schools comprise an additional 9%.

Studying abroad has become more attractive to Brazilian students, due to the number of students in universities and the favorable economy, as well as the Scientific Mobility Program described above. Brazil ranks 14th in the world as country of origin for foreign students who are studying at U.S. universities. According to a report by the Institute of International Education (IIE), 9,029 Brazilian students studied in the U.S. in 2012, a 6% increase from 2011.

The consensus is that these numbers will continue to increase over the next few years, due to the Scientific Mobility Program, which was created in 2010 by President Rouseff. By the end of 2012, 22,600 scholarships had been awarded to Brazilians, the majority of whom study in the U.S. Twenty-two percent of all Scientific Mobility students (almost 5,000) were placed in 238 U.S. universities. Most of these students (58%) are attending undergraduate courses.

The Brazilian Government has partnered with IIE to administer the Brazil Scientific Mobility Program for U.S. educational institutions. Accredited American colleges and universities interested in hosting students through the program should register with IIE at: [http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility](http://www.iie.org/Programs/Brazil-Scientific-Mobility).

###Sub-Sector Best Prospects 

Return to top

Approximately 80% of Brazilian students who study abroad come from Brazil’s southern and central eastern states. São Paulo has the largest applicant pool, and also attracts the most talented students to its own university campuses. The capital city of Brasília, located in Distrito Federal (Federal District) has the country’s highest GDP per capita, at approximately US$25,000, over twice that of São Paulo, its closest competitor state. The state of Rio de Janeiro, home of the largest company in Latin America, Petrobras, is the country’s energy hub, attracting many engineering and science majors.

The main challenge for many Brazilian students applying for study abroad programs is their lack of English language skills. Institutions that can address this issue by providing conditional acceptance tied to English language training may have a competitive advantage in attracting Brazilian students.

For this reason, in 2012 the Ministry of Education launched “English without Borders”, an initiative to support university students that improves English language teaching in schools through a variety of learning methodologies. Approximately 2 million user accounts will be provided to an online English teaching course, over 250,000 TOEFL exams will be offered to assess students’ language ability, and classroom courses will be provided by public universities to those students who fit the profile for the Scientific Mobility Program.

The Brazil Scientific Mobility Undergraduate Program focuses on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields. Engineering and computer science are by far the most popular majors; however, a number of students are enrolled in social science, business, and the arts (focused on products and processes for technological development and innovation). Below are the top 10 fields of study among Scientific Mobility students:

**TOP TEN FIELDS OF STUDY**

* Mechanical Engineering
* Electrical Engineering
* Computer Sciences Industrial Engineering
* Civil Engineering
* Computer Engineering
* Biology
* Medicine
* Environmental Science

###Opportunities 

Return to top

With sustained economic growth and increased availability of credit, Brazilian families have been able to plan and make longer term financial commitments, and are purchasing homes, cars, and other durable goods in higher numbers. As the lower income portion of the market becomes more sophisticated and families become more aware of the importance of quality education, opportunities for educational services will continue to grow. U.S. schools interested in recruiting in Brazil should provide creative financing options, since cost (along with proficiency in English language skills) will continue to be the biggest challenge for Brazilian students studying abroad.

Since 2007, the Education Ministry has been investing in “PROINFO”, a program that promotes information technology as an important teaching tool. The program provides installations of technology labs in public schools, laptops for teachers and students, digital boards, projectors and tablets. The budget will also be used to invest in classroom infrastructure and training for teachers. In 2013, the government will continue to invest in the technology program with additional purchases of tablets for teachers, computers for technology laboratories at schools and universities, smart and digital boards, projectors, and other learning technologies.

Brazil’s book purchasing program is also receiving increased attention. Currently, school books are purchased every three years, although the procurement process starts three years before the actual purchase. In May 2013, the Ministry of Education opened the process for book purchases for 2016; the budget allocated for 2016 school book purchases is US$800 million. The purchasing program is divided into three categories: books used in libraries, textbooks for students, and reference material books for teachers.

For the next decade, the fastest growing segment of the educational market in Brazil will be short term vocational courses, due to government investments in technical schools and courses for high schools students and adults. Over the past five years, demand for professional/vocational courses grew 50%. In 2011, the Government of Brazil launched “PRONATEC” (National Program for Technical Courses) and designated US$3.5 billion for the program. Since its inception, PRONATEC has funded technical and vocational courses and 2.5 million students, and expects to fund an additional 2.3 million students for 2013. It is projected that by the end of 2014, the program will fund an additional 8 million students’ courses. Those companies and educational institutions interested in participating in these programs should consider partnering with local companies or universities. The National Confederation of Industry (CNI) thru its Technical Schools SESI and SENAI is also offering the courses. Brazil recognizes the need to improve English language skills across the country. However, the majority of the population, including those employed in the tourism sector, lack basic English language skills. New government programs, both at the federal and local levels, are addressing this deficiency. For example, the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES), a foundation within the Ministry of Education in Brazil whose central purpose is to coordinate efforts to improve the quality of Brazil’s faculty and staff in higher education through grant programs, recently launched a program providing scholarships for intensive English language training in the U.K. for Brazilians that are certified in teaching English. The State of Bahia is sponsoring free English classes for taxi drivers. Private English language schools throughout the larger cities are abundant.

The Ministry of Education is in the early stages of creating a system to recognize foreign university degrees. Once the system is established, foreign universities will have to register to be included on the Ministry’s list, intended to be a fast-track system for students to have their foreign diplomas recognized.

**Education Fairs and Trade Shows**

The country’s many education fairs are one of the most efficient means to recruit Brazilian students, including the annual “EducationUSA”, supported by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs (ECA). This year’s fairs will take place in late August to early September 2014. Universities interested in participating and exhibiting at the fairs should contact the Education USA office in Brazil.
