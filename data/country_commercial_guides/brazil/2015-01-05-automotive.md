With annual sales of 3.8 million units in 2013, Brazil is currently the world’s fourth largest market for automobiles, behind China, USA and Japan. Industry sources expect Brazil’s market to double its size by 2025, with significant sales increase in Korean, Japanese and Chinese brands. The domestic production of automobiles, including buses and trucks, is expected to reach 5 million units in 2017, much of which will be exported.

Net sales revenue of the automobile industry in Brazil is about US$ 84 billion, which corresponds to nearly 19% of the country’s GDP. Despite the increasing presence of new OEMs in the market, sales of Fiat, Ford, GM and VW models account for 67% of the total market.

The Automobile Industry Association estimates for 2014 are that domestic sales will increase by 1.1%, local production will grow by 0.7%, exports will increase by 2.1% and as a result of the automotive policies in place, imports will continue their downward path. Credit restriction, lower income growth rates, the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, presidential elections in October, and Carnival holidays in March, instead of February, were some of the factors attributed to the expected low sales growth rate this year.

Nonetheless, the domestic demand for automobiles has drastically increased in the past years, from 1.6 million in 2005 to 3.8 million in 2013, as government programs and economic stability increased consumer spending and raised large portions of the population upwards in the consumer market. Credit availability and government incentives in the automotive sector were also essential for the market growth. The ratio of inhabitants per vehicle in Brazil dropped from 11 at the end of the 1990s to 5.5 currently, confirming that there is room for significant market growth.

Because of the importance of the automotive industry to Brazil’s economy, its job creation capacity and the political influence of the OEMs, government policies have traditionally protected Brazil’s domestic auto industry from international competition. As an example, in 2011 the Brazilian Ministry of Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade (MDIC), increased the tax on industrial products on imported automobiles outside of the Mercosul trade zone, by thirty percent. In some cases, higher IPI, the 35% import tax and other related taxes, increase the price of imported cars by over 100%. The effect of higher prices of imported vehicles is reflected in the 35.2% reduction in sales of imported cars in 2012 and 13.4% in 2013, after having reached a record level of 853,000 units in 2011. Sales of the Chinese models Chery and JAC, as well as the Korean Kia, were the most hurt. On the other hand, domestic purchases of imported luxury models as BMW, Land Rover and Audi increased by 30% in 2013. It is important to note that Brazil has free trade agreements with the Mercosur countries and Mexico. In 2011, VW, GM, Ford and Fiat, which all have manufactured automobiles in Brazil for many years, were responsible for 37% of the supply of imported vehicles. These OEMs complement their line of locally produced vehicles with imported models, mostly from Argentina and Mexico.

The domestic demand for automobiles consists mostly of basic hatch and mid-size models, in contrast to the USA market, which has high demand for mid-size and luxury sedans.

Current Market Trends

The automotive industry in Brazil is predominantly driven by the domestic market. The “Made in Brazil” models usually feature low embedded technology, yet are among the most expensive in the world. Most of the innovations in the industry are related to the introduction of embedded electronics, safety and design equipment.

In order to further stimulate the automotive industry and attract investments, in October 2012, the Brazilian Government issued a program, known as the Inovar Auto (Decree 7819), designed to support the automotive industry’s technology development, innovation, safety, environmental protection, energy efficiency and quality improvement. In order to benefit from tax reduction incentives, OEMs are expected to invest in research and development in Brazil and to achieve production of more economical, lower priced and safer vehicles. The Inovar Auto program is valid until December 2017, and benefits both those OEMs that have already established manufacturing plants in country and other international OEMs whose new production plant projects have been approved by the government. Companies that apply for Inovar Auto commit to having their Made-in-Brazil models achieve increased energy efficiency levels (i.e. an average drop of 12% in fuel consumption).

As far as automobile safety is concerned, legislation of 2009, determined that as of January 2014, all vehicles made in Brazil be equipped with air bags and ABS brakes. To comply with these safety requirements and introduce the new security devices, the tier 1, 2 and 3 suppliers, which include companies like Bosch do Brasil, Continental and TRW have invested from US$ 250 to 400 million.

###Sub-Sector Best Prospects 

Return to top

The Inovar Auto program initiated a new investment cycle in the automotive sector in Brazil, through which the industry will produce world class, high value-added products. Some of the expected results of the program are that the OEMs will increase their investments in high productivity equipment and processes, which allow lower energy consumption; and in precision measurement and testing equipment, quality standard certifications, training, and increased use of light materials, so as to reach the emission reduction target of 18.84% of CO2/Km. It is also expected that OEMs will increase the amount of automobile project designs in Brazil.

The industry is also evaluating new propulsion technologies, which include the use of flex fuel engines in hybrid vehicles and application of ethanol in fuel cells. In order to develop technologies for producing electric and hybrid vehicles in Brazil in 2017, ANFAVEA requested temporary tax exemption on a limited number of imported electric and hybrid automobiles, as well as on repair parts, until 2016. Some developments are underway to introduce electric vehicles in Brazil.

###Opportunities 

Return to top

Increased taxes on imported vehicles and Inovar Auto Program incentives are attracting substantial automotive investments. Industry experts reported that eight OEMs (Audi, BMW, Chery, Foton, JAC, Land Rover, MB and Sinotruck) will build their first automobile plants in Brazil from 2014 to 2016, which corresponds to investments of R$5 Billion (US$2.12 billion), whereas the already established Fiat, Honda and Nissan will build new plants.

There are currently approximately 40 automobile manufacturing plants in Brazil, as follows:

Automobile Plants: (Toyota, Ford, GM, VW, Fiat, Mitsubishi, Hyundai, Peugeot, Citroen, Mercedes Benz, Renault, Nissan, Honda);

Truck Plants: (Mercedes Benz, Agrale, Iveco, Ford, International, MAN, Scania, Volvo);

Bus Plants: (Agrale, Iveco, MAN, Mercedes Benz, Scania, Volvo and the newly established DAF Trucks).

Nearly all Brazil-made cars are flex fuel, and run on ethanol, gasoline or any combination of the two fuels. Brazil’s automotive parts industry consists of Brazilian owned (27% of the sales value) and internationally owned (73% of the sales value) companies. There is a significant presence of U.S. automotive parts suppliers, including Delphi, Visteon, TRW, Dana, Arvin-Meritor, Cummins Engines, MWM-Diesel, and Eaton.

Inovar Auto requires that several production processes be performed in Brazil and also establishes local content requirement for automotive parts. There are currently discussions about the implementation of an Inovar Autoparts program, which will, among other items, consist of financial support to local automotive parts manufacturers and include measures to attract direct investments to the sector. According to the National Automobile Industry Association (ANFAVEA), the process of tracking the origin of imported automotive parts is expected to start in the next few months. This should help Brazil’s auto parts industry identify the OEMs needs and allow them to substitute imported parts with local production.
