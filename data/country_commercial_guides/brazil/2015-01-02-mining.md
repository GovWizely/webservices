Brazil is the world’s fifth largest mineral producer and, as a result, one of the world’s largest markets for mining equipment. The highest output for most minerals in Brazil was achieved in 2008. In 2009, a big recession followed in the international mining market, and while output of most minerals has since increased, the level is still below the record year of 2008. Prices for mineral commodities depend basically on the international market and have decreased significantly in the last few years, negatively impacting the financial situation of most Brazilian mining companies.

IBRAM released an estimate in March 2014, stating that local mining companies will invest US$53.6 billion in new projects between 2014 and 2018. This is considered a very low volume of investments, given the potential of the country, especially when compared to US$75 billion previously estimated for the period 2012 to 2016. Most of the cutbacks in the total volume of investment were in iron ore, which is Brazil’s main mineral and is responsible for nearly 60% of the total investments in mining in Brazil. Brazil’s iron ore operations have an output of nearly 500 million metric tons/year (Mt/y), representing 16% of the world’s total.

According to IBRAM, there are several reasons for the slowdown in this sector, notably falling prices for commodities, excessive bureaucracy for the necessary environmental permits, difficulty in raising local capital and a federal mining regulatory framework which is currently undergoing revision by Congress. The price per ton for iron ore has fallen from a peak of US$190 in 2011 to between US$110 - 115. The price for gold has fallen to 45% below its peak price in 2011. As of today, at least 14 gold projects or operations have been halted in Brazil, most by smaller companies. The price of aluminum likewise fell 60% during the last four years, and three big projects have been halted for this reason.

China has played a very important role for Brazilian mining companies. The nation has become the largest importer of Brazil’s minerals, especially iron ore. Most of the new projects developed or planned in Brazil are tied to China’s demand for Brazilian mineral resources.

The full potential for output of Brazilian minerals has not been fully surveyed, and significant discoveries of mineral deposits are expected in the future. Investments in geological exploration in Brazil in 2013 are estimated to have been US$ 300 million, very low when compared to US$1.6 billion in Australia.

The most important minerals in Brazil, with their respective production stated in millions of metric tons per year (Mt/y), or metric tons per year (t/y) in 2013, and the Brazilian share of the world production are:

![Chapter 4 - Mineral Production](images/chap4-mineral-production.png)

Brazil is the world’s largest producer of niobium, the second largest producer of iron ore and manganese, and the third largest producer of bauxite.

The total value of mineral commodities produced in Brazil in 2013 is estimated to be US$44 billion, concentrated in the central state of Minas Gerais (45% of the total), and in the northern state of Pará (in the Carajás mining area, in the Amazon region), with 30% of the total. Brazil’s coal production is small and has been stagnant for the last 20 years. The output in 2012 was only 6 Mt/y of steam coal (compared to 5 Mt/y in 1991), only 0.2% of the world’s total, but there are plans to increase its output to 12 Mt by 2017, in order to supply several new local coal power plants. Total Brazilian deposits of coal are estimated to be 32 billion metric tons, or only 0.3% of the world’s total. There are nine coal power plants currently in operation in Brazil, with a combined capacity of 3.205 MW, equivalent to only 2% of the total electricity consumption of the country. There are projects by local companies underway to start up several new coal power plants in Brazil in the next five years, for a combined capacity of 3,000 MW (megawatts).

Brazil is one of the largest importers of metallurgical coal, used by local steel manufacturers. It has imported approximately 16 million metric tons/year (US$2 billion) of metallurgical coal. Metallurgical coal totaled 40% of the total value of Brazilian mineral imports in 2012. The main supplying countries have been Australia, U.S.A., Canada, and South Africa. Vale, the largest Brazilian mining company, has made large investments in coal mining in Australia and in Mozambique in the last five years. It had an output of 8.8 Mt/y of coal in these countries during 2013. The total deposits are 2.5 billion metric tons, and the total output is planned to reach 40 Mt/year.

The U.S. has always been one of the largest exporting countries to the Brazilian mining equipment market, with a share of 20% to 30% of Brazilian imports. Official statistics show that the U.S. has exported hundreds of types of components for mining machinery in Brazil. Other very strong exporters competing with U.S. interests are Germany, Sweden, Canada, China, France, Italy, Finland, and Japan.

Gold: The total Brazilian output of gold in 2012 was 70 metric tons of gold metal. It is expected to expand to 90 t/y of gold metal in 2016, according to the Brazilian Mining Institute. The Canadian Kinross Group became Brazil’s largest gold producer in 2008, when it started up a new project of US$ 550 million and increased its output of gold metal from 5.4 to 17.2 metric tons / year. Other large producers of gold in Brazil are AngloGold Ashanti, Yamana Gold and Jaguar Mining. Individual prospectors have a share of nearly 13% of the total output.

###Sub-Sector Best Prospects 

Return to top

Brazil has a very limited market for turnkey machinery in general, as a large number of leading multinational manufacturers have their own factories in Brazil. In fact, many of them even export their products. These companies, though, provide excellent opportunities for U.S. manufacturers of hundreds of parts and components for most types of mining equipment, such as earth-moving machines, belt conveyors, crushers and grinding equipment, laboratory instruments, drill bits and geological survey systems.

Products (or components) that are not locally produced, either by foreign or local firms have the highest success rate for entry into the market. Otherwise, the imported product will need to offer much higher technology or cost/benefit compared to the locally-made ones, as local companies tend to prefer buying locally even if there is a difference in quality. Import taxes and fees in Brazil are very high in the mining sector, and import procedures complicated and bureaucratic, forcing buyers to favor local over imported products. Most of Brazil’s mines are open pit, so the market for underground mining equipment is very small, though more underground mines are expected to open in the future.

###Opportunities 

Return to top

The Brazilian market for mining equipment is very competitive. Most large multinational manufacturers have factories in Brazil, where they manufacture for the domestic market and frequently also export from Brazil to many other countries. Typically, these companies use 50% to 90% Brazilian-made components to build their equipment in Brazil, in terms of value of the final product. For example, Caterpillar has a huge factory in Brazil, with total sales of more than US$2 billion/year, and it exports more than 50% of its Brazilian- made machines all over the world. In 2012, Caterpillar, which has produced a traditional line of earthmoving machinery in Brazil for over 50 years, has added a locomotive factory.

Additional U.S. and other international firms with factories in Brazil include:

Australia Orica

Finland Metso, Outokumpu

France Michelin Tires, Saint Gobain

Germany Koch, Kuttner, Liebherr, MAN, Mercedes Benz, Schaeffler, Schenk Process, Siemens, Thyssen Krupp, Voith, WehrAlstom

Italy Case New Holland, FIAT, Iveco

Japan Komatsu, NSK, Toshiba

Sweden Asea BB, Atlas Copco, Sandvik, Scania, SKF, Tamrock, Volvo

UK JCB

USA 3M, Cummins, Eaton, GE, Goodyear, Ingersoll Rand, ITT, P&H

MinePro, Terex, Timken

There are many Brazilian manufacturers competing with similar technologies, or which have technology transfer agreements with foreign companies and dominate big shares of the domestic market. The largest ones include Bardella, Dedini, Isomonte, Jaraguá, Randon, and Villares. There are also hundreds of medium-sized Brazilian companies that specialize in manufacturing all types of parts and components for the suppliers of turn-key equipment.

**Prospective Buyers:**

**VALE S.A. (Formerly known as Companhia Vale do Rio Doce)** is Brazil’s largest, and the world’s second largest mining company. Privatized in 1997, VALE is responsible for nearly 50% of Brazil’s mineral output in terms of value, and represents an excellent opportunity for U.S. equipment suppliers. VALE produces nearly 80% of all Brazil’s iron ore output, 100% of potash, 85% of manganese, 43% of kaolin, 80% of bauxite, and is also the top player in aluminum, copper, and nickel production. The output of its main minerals in 2013 was 299.8 million metric tons (Mt) of iron ore, plus 39.0 Mt of iron ore pellets, 2.378 Mt of manganese ore, 260,000 tons of nickel (metal content in ore), 15 Mt of bauxite, 370,000 tons of copper (contents in ore), 492,000 tons of potassium chloride, 8.8 Mt of coal and 8.3 Mt of phosphate rock. VALE is also the top logistics player in Brazil, especially for ports and railroads, not only for its own use, but also as a supplier of logistics services to other companies. It is the largest Brazilian consumer of electricity. Over the last decade, VALE has diversified further, buying the Canadian company INCO (the world’s largest nickel producer), and increasing coal projects in Australia and Mozambique.

**Anglo American** has a large iron ore project located in Minas Gerais, which will start producing in 2014 with an output of 26 million metric tons. Since 2010, Anglo also has a big nickel project named “Barro Alto,” with an output of 36,000 t/year in Ferro-nickel alloys.

**AngloGold Ashanti** is the second largest gold producer in Brazil, with an output of nearly 500,000 troy ounces/year, and projects to increase its output in Brazil to 670,000 troy ounces in the next three years.

**MMX** started three large iron ore projects in Brazil in 2007, but most part of these projects have been either sold or postponed. Its output in 2012 was 9 million t/y of iron ore.

**Usiminas**, Brazil’s largest steel manufacturer has an output of currently 13 Mt of iron ore, and projects to expand to 29 Mt by 2017, in a joint-venture with Japanese-owned Sumitomo.

**CSN** operations yielded 30 Mt/y of iron ore in 2013, with a project to expand its output to 40 Mt/y. It is also the second largest Brazilian steel producer.

**ArcelorMittal** had an output of 4 Mt of iron ore in 2012, and projects expansion to 10 Mt by 2015. This company is Brazil’s third largest steel producer.

**Samarco** yielded 24 Mt of iron ore and 17 Mt/y of iron ore pellets in 2012. The company is a consortium between Vale and BHP Billiton. It started a new pelletizing mill in April 2014, increasing its capacity to 30 Mt of pellets.

**Kinross** Group of Canada became Brazil’s largest gold producer in 2008, when it started up a new project of US$ 550 million and increased its output of gold metal from 5.4 to 17.2 metric tons /year.

**Votorantim** is the only local producer of zinc, and has a share of approximately 40% of the local production of cement. This Brazilian group is a big producer of bauxite and aluminum.

**MRN** is the largest producer of bauxite in the world, with 18 Mt/y. The company is a consortium that includes Vale (40%), BHP Billiton Metals (14.8%), Alcan (12%), CBA (10%), Alcoa (13.58%), Norsk Hydro (5%), and Abalco (4.62%).

**Market Entry:**

It is absolutely necessary for foreign manufacturers of equipment to have some degree of local presence in Brazil. Most multinational manufacturers of mining equipment already have factories in Brazil. Smaller companies that cannot afford to establish a local subsidiary must at least have a good Brazilian representative that can supply or subcontract technical maintenance and some degree of local assembling.

Brazil’s mining companies, even the very large ones, prefer to contact a Brazil-based representative and do all the import procedures through them, instead of contacting the foreign suppliers directly.

Price and just-in-time delivery for components are key factors for most importers. Some large mining companies have their own bonded warehouses where they store imported products in Brazil, locked under customs’ agreement. These products will go through customs and be paid only when they really need to be used. Unskilled labor is relatively cheap in Brazil compared to the U.S., so equipment that eliminates large numbers of employees is not necessarily financially attractive to Brazilian companies. Highly qualified labors, especially engineers, earn wages that are competitive with those in the U.S.

Import taxes in Brazil are very high. Import duty on mining equipment is normally between 5 to 12%, calculated based on the CIF (cost, insurance and freight) price. These import duties are adopted as a single tariff structure for the Mercosul free trade area which also includes Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela. There are also three local taxes.

The following taxes apply to both local and foreign products:

- IPI Industrialized Products Tax, federal tax calculated on top of the CIF price plus Import Tax, is 5% to 8% for most products

- ICMS Merchandise and Services Circulation Tax, a state government value-added tax, is 18% of the final price in most Brazilian states and products

- PIS/COFINS, Social Integration and Social Security Financing Contributions: 9.25% but can represent up to 12.63% of the CIF price due to complex calculation formula 

- Additional Miscellaneous Taxes and Fees: Warehousing, handling charges at port, transportation, etc.

Exposibram, the Brazilian mining show, is held every year in September, alternating between the cities of Belo Horizonte and Belem. It is sponsored and organized by IBRAM, with support from most local mining companies and manufacturers of mining equipment. This show is recommended for U.S. companies looking to understand or partner with Brazilian mining companies, and to make personal contact with related government entities that travel to the show from around the country. Kallman Worldwide is the representative of this show in the USA. Website: [http://www.exposibram.org.br](http://www.exposibram.org.br)
