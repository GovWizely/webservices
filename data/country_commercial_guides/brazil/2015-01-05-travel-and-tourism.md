###Overview 

Return to top

Brazil has recently surpassed Germany as the 3rd largest source of overseas visitors to the United States (excluding Canada and Mexico), and is the top arrivals market from South America. Brazil accounts for more than 30% of all arrivals in the United States from that continent.

With both the fifth largest land mass and population in the world, recent economic growth, and a growing middle class, the nation of Brazil accounts for ever-increasing numbers of visitors to the US; totals are expected to continue significantly increases for years to come. At a major travel and tourism awards event in Brazil in 2013, the U.S. was recognized as the #1 destination of choice for first-time Brazilian international travelers and the destination of choice for Brazilians that have yet to make their first trip abroad.

In 2010, the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Office of Travel and Tourism Industry (OTTI) reported that Brazil had a 34% increase in the number of arrivals to the United States, reaching a record 1,197,000 visitors. The rate of growth continued in 2011, when 1,508,279 Brazilians visited the United States, representing an increase of 26% over the previous year. Arrivals from Brazil in 2012 reached 1,791,103 visitors, an 18.8% increase over 2011. In 2013, more than 2 million Brazilian travelers visited the U.S., a 15% increase over 2012:

Spending by Brazilian visitors to the United States continues to grow every year. In 2012, Brazilians accounted for US$9.3 billion in expenditures while staying in the U.S., or more than US$5,000 per visitor. Expenditures by Brazilians in the United States in 2013 reached a record-breaking number of $10.5 billion.

The US Department of Commerce expects the total number of Brazilian visitors to the U.S. will increase to even higher levels by the end of 2014. In 2012, the State Department added more consular officers at its visa issuing posts in Brazil to speed up the visa application process.

It is notable that São Paulo is one of the top three visa issuing U.S. Embassy/consulate posts in the world. In 2013, Brazil issued more than 1.1 million U.S. visas; more than 50% of those visas were adjudicated at Consulate São Paulo.

The table below shows the top 20 countries that sent tourists to the United States in 2013:

###Sub-Sector Best Prospects

The U.S. is Brazil’s second most popular travel destination, just behind neighboring Argentina. More Brazilians are traveling to the U.S. because of promotions offered by U.S. companies and the increasing spending power of the Brazilian middle class.

The high season for Brazilian travel to the U.S. is December through January, and July during school holidays. Shorter trips during public holidays are also very popular. Fly and drive trips are becoming increasingly attractive to Brazilian families wishing to drive through Arizona, California, Nevada, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana or New England.

**Brazil’s Travel & Tourism Distribution System**

While wholesalers are key travel distributors, Brazil’s has 10,000 travel agencies with 60% of agencies issuing international tickets. Many travel agencies also serve as tour operators. As a result, the competition is stiff, prompting many agencies to upgrade technologies to improve efficiency.

Associations are important in Brazil’s travel industry. The Brazilian Tour Operators Association (Braztoa), formed by 70 operators, is the main association of tour operators. The Brazilian Travel Agencies Association (ABAV) has approximately 3,500 members responsible for just over 80% of travel sales. The majority of Brazil’s visitors to the U.S. go through a travel agency, while others go directly to airlines to purchase tickets through the Internet. Others use state/city travel offices. 

###Opportunities 

Return to top

Travel and tourism promotion in Brazil has seen success over the past two decades. Brazil’s large and diverse population means the country has a broad set of interests from which U.S. destinations can recruit travelers. For a U.S. destination, finding the hook for potential Brazilian travelers could lead to great returns.

Those working in tourism may want to capture some of the increasing niche markets of Brazilian travelers to the United States. Among Brazilians traveling with the specific aim of shopping, agents should consider tours specifically designed to cater to soon-to-be mothers and wedding shoppers. Officers also indicated that modest Brazilian shoppers find inexpensive accommodations in the outskirts of major cities and even take advantage of outlet shopping. Another growing market is the adventurous traveler who aspires to trek the famous Route 66 or participate in motorcycle road tours in the South.

Among first time travelers, Florida remains a popular destination, but some are making New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New Orleans or Las Vegas their first destination as well. Within this group, many have specific intentions to drive along the California coast, or drive from Los Angeles to Las Vegas. Married Brazilian couples have also renewed their vows in various themed wedding chapels in Las Vegas.

Amongst young professional and business travelers, many opt to use their 30 days of vacation for an extended stay in the United States. Many take a light load of English language courses as incidental to tourism. Hours spent outside of class are dedicated to exploring a major city and getting a taste of American living before returning home. Agents should also take note of hobbyists and professional shoppers traveling to the U.S. specifically to purchase equipment, i.e., photographers, disc jockeys, artists, and farmers. Chicago, for example, is a major destination for architects and building lovers.

Several Brazilian travelers obtain U.S. visas with the specific purpose of transiting to destinations in Canada, Mexico, Japan and Caribbean cruises with the intention of adding a quick stay in the U.S. for shopping. Agents may want to capture this market to facilitate the needs of these travelers, who simply want quick and easy access to shopping and dining.

Each year, the U.S. Commercial Service in Brazil organizes the **VISIT USA** shows. This is the most effective and affordable vehicle for the U.S. travel trade industry to increase its market exposure in Brazil. **VISIT USA 2014 Brazil** took place in Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Campinas (interior of the state of São Paulo) in May 2014, and was visited by over 1,600 select travel agents, tour operators and media visitors in all three cities.
