<div id="standards-conformity-assessment">
On November 20, 2007, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and over 90 private entities including product certifiers, product inspectors, and accredited testing, calibration and assay laboratories, enacted the creation of Colombia’s National Accreditation Organization (ONAC) as a public-private organization following the guidelines of the National Quality Policy and with the aim to allow international recognition of the country’s conformity assessment certificates including laboratory testing, and calibration certificates in accordance with ISO/IEC 17011 standards.

Per Decrees 4738 and 3257 of 2008, ONAC accredits and supervises the certification entities, as well as testing and calibration laboratories, a task previously assigned to the SIC, through the Delegated Superintendent for Consumer Protection (SDPC).
