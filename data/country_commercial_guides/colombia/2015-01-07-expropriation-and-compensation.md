Article 58 of the Constitution governs indemnifications and expropriations and guarantees ownersâ€™ rights for legally-acquired property. For assets taken by eminent

domain, Colombian law provides a right of appeal both on the basis of the decision itself and on the level of compensation. The Constitution does not specify how to proceed in compensation cases, which remains a concern for foreign investors. The Colombian government has sought to resolve such concerns through the negotiation of bilateral investment treaties and strong investment chapters in free trade agreements, such as the FTA.
