The outlook for the Colombian electricity sector is promising since the GOC is planning to develop several new power generation projects through 2018, mostly hydro, to accommodate the expanded demand. Additionally, the GOC is exploring prospects for becoming a major exporter of electricity (including goods and services) to the Andean region and Central America.

As a result of this trend some solid business prospects exist to continue using hydroelectric plants with gas-fueled thermal energy generators, including cogeneration systems. Also, electricity trading and distribution companies are focusing on reducing losses by acquiring leading- edge management and control systems technologies. Another promising business opportunity is the Rural Energy Program, aimed at providing electrical power to off-grid areas using renewable energy systems such as solar, wind, and small and medium scale hydro plants. This program calls for new generation systems and improving existing systems. The GOC has taken steps to secure funding for the program.

To assist with these GOC efforts, the U.S. Trade and Development Agency has awarded feasibility study grants for a geothermal power plant (ISAGEN), a 20 MW landfill waste-to-energy facility, and a proposed solar-wind power project. In addition, USTDA is also supporting the GOC’s interest in applying SmartGrid technologies to improve the nation’s high-voltage transmission and distribution network.
