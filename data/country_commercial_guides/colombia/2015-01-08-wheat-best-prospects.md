<div id="wheat-best-prospects">
FTA implementation has greatly helped the United States to recover lost wheat import market share at the expense of Canada and MERCOSUR. Zero duties and no quota will create more competitive trade conditions against MERCOSUR wheat, which is subject to a price band mechanism, where duties fluctuate based on a reference price. Canadian wheat, which also has zero duties and no quota, will be the primary competitor.
