Since 1969, Colombia has been a member of the Andean Community, which constitutes a free trade agreement with Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru. Venezuela left the Andean Community in April 2011. A new framework to facilitate limited commercial relations was negotiated in 2011 and entered into force in October 2012. The Andean Community

reached a free trade agreement with Mercosur countries (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay) in 2005.

President Santos’ Administration has energetically pursued measures to liberalize trade. The United States Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (FTA) entered into force on May 15, 2012. For additional information and the final texts of the FTAFTA agreement please visit: http://www.ustr.gov/uscolombiatpa.

Apart from the FTAFTA, Colombia has various free- trade agreements with individual countries or associations, which include the Central American Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras), Canada, Mexico, Chile, the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries (Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), and the European Union. Colombia signed an FTA with South Korea in February 2013 with Costa Rica in May 2013, with Panama in June 2013, and with Israel in September 2013. Colombia is currently negotiating trade agreements with Turkey and Japan.

In addition, to stimulate trade and investment, Colombia has Bilateral Investment Treaties (BITs) with Switzerland, Peru and Spain; Colombia has included investment protection chapters in FTAs with Chile, México, Canada, EFTA countries, El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and the United States. Additional BITs have been negotiated with China, India, and the United Kingdom.
