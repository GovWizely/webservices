With regard to auto parts, Colombia is the United States’ fifth largest trading partner in Latin America and the United States is Colombia’s third largest trading partner after China and Mexico. Colombia’s competitive economy provides opportunities for U.S. manufacturers. Two main areas for opportunities in the automotive industry in Colombia are:

1. Vehicles: Public transport systems in the principal cities (Bogota, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Cartagena, Cali, Pereira, among others). Cities will increase the purchase of new vehicles and a standardization of existing models. The city of Bogota launched the “Plan de Ascenso Tecnológico”, (Technological Improvement Plan) a technology improvement plan for zero or low carbon emissions in the mass transportation sector for Bogota – Transmilenio Bus Rapid Transit (BRT). The plan contemplates replacing the current fleet with low emission buses.

2. Auto parts: The high vehicle import percentage represents good opportunities for all imported parts and accessories, especially for U.S. products which are very well known and regarded nationwide. Additionally, under the FTA agreement which entered entered into effect on May 15, 2012, some parts and auto parts (which were previously assessed a tariff of 13 percent on average) currently enter the Colombian market tariff free, while tariffs on other parts will be reduced to zero over the next 5-10 years.

With this implementation Colombia is accepting re-manufactured auto parts listed under Chapter Four, Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures, Section A - Rules of Origin, ANNEX 4.18. Goods classified in the following Harmonized System subheadings may be considered remanufactured goods that would be allowed to be imported into Colombia 8702, 8703, 8704.21,8704.31, 8704.32, 8706, and 8707:8408.10, 8408.20, 8408.90, 8409.91, 8409.99, 8412.21, 8412.29, 8412.39, 8412.90, 8413.30, 8413.50, 8413.60, 8413.91, 8414.30,8414.80,8414.90,8419.89,8431.20,8431.49,8481.20, 8481.40,8481.80,8481.90,8483.10,8483.30,8483.40,8483.50,8483.60,8483.90,8503.00, 8511.40,8511.50,8526.10,8537.10,8542.21,8708.31,8708.39,8708.40,8708.60,8708.70, 8708.93,8708.99,9031.49.

Other provisions of the FTA include strong protection for U.S. investors (legal stability), expanded access to service markets, greater intellectual property rights protection, market access for remanufactured goods, increased transparency and improved dispute settlement mechanisms (arbitration). Under the National Treatment Caveat within the FTA, U.S. companies must be treated as locals when they participate in public bids, eliminating the disadvantage they used to face prior to the signing of the agreement.
