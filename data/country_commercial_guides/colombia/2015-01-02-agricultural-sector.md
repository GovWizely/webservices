**Consumer Oriented Products**

####Overview [Return to top](#chap4)

Demand in Colombia for consumer oriented and other high-value food products has been growing steadily since the early 1990s. Specific products showing an increase in sales since then are red meat, fresh/frozen pork, mechanically de-boned chicken meat, hatching eggs, fresh fruits, processed fruits and vegetables, pet food, beer, nursery products, and various types of snacks and prepared foods. The main conditions that support the rise of consumer oriented product trade include: Colombia’s consistent annual economic growth above 4 percent, an expanding middle class, falling poverty, and changing consumer tastes and preferences.

####Best Prospects/Services [Return to top](#chap4)

Strong foreign direct investment in Colombia is likely to continue and although the Colombian peso has slightly weakened against the dollar, the impact on imports from the United States will be negligible.

Historically, Chile has been the principal supplier of imported fresh fruits to Colombia, but Colombian retailers are seeking to increase their supply of U.S. fruits, such as apples, pears and other products. Foreign competition in wine is primarily from Chile, Argentina, Spain, and France. Marketing efforts continue to introduce and expand high-quality U.S. wines to a growing consumer base in Colombia. South American countries receive a preferential duty as members of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and/or the Andean Community of Nations. The implementation of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (FTA) effectively removed import duties for most consumer oriented products; however, some products still have a 5-year phase out period.

Although the production of domestic processed foods is growing, imports play an increasingly important role to meet a growing consumer demand and changes in tastes and preferences. Sustained economic growth in the past two years and strong competition in the supermarket sector has also had an important impact on imports. The United States is the principal foreign supplier of consumer oriented food products to Colombia. U.S. food products are highly regarded in the Colombian market for their quality and value as well as for their wide diversity.

####Opportunities [Return to top](#chap4)

U.S. food companies looking to break into the Colombian market for consumer oriented food products and beverages should consider visiting Colombia to conduct a preliminary market analysis and meet potential buyers. Implementation of the FTA provided increased opportunities for U.S. food and beverages and it is critical to develop business relationships with Colombian counterparts. There will also be increased opportunities for foreign direct investment with local food processing companies.

###WHEAT

####Overview [Return to top](#chap4)

![Wheat](images/wheat.png)

Wheat production is marginal in Colombia and is expected to average about 24 thousand metric tons annually. Colombia’s wheat is primarily of low quality and is not likely to expand. Under the FTA, the U.S. wheat enters Colombia with zero duty and no quota. Prior to FTA implementation, U.S. market share fell due to duty preferences for imports from the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and Canada. FTA implementation created more favorable trade circumstances for U.S. wheat with greater opportunities for trade.

####Best Prospects/Services [Return to top](#chap4)

FTA implementation has greatly helped the United States to recover lost wheat import market share at the expense of Canada and MERCOSUR. Zero duties and no quota will create more competitive trade conditions against MERCOSUR wheat, which is subject to a price band mechanism, where duties fluctuate based on a reference price. Canadian wheat, which also has zero duties and no quota, will be the primary competitor.

####Opportunities [Return to top](#chap4)

While bread consumption in Colombia remains low, there has been a steady increase in Colombian pasta consumption creating increased demand for high-quality Durum wheat.

###Corn 

####Overview [Return to top](#chap4)


Colombia’s yellow corn production is challenged by low productivity and is very susceptible to weather conditions and plant pests. As a result, about 60 percent of the market is satisfied by imports. Colombian imports of U.S. corn have fallen in recent years because of high prices and strong competition from MERCOSUR. Colombian corn demand is expected to increase because of growing feed needs from the Colombian poultry sector. Under the FTA, U.S. yellow and white corn are subject to a tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) to be phased out over 12 years.

####Best Prospects/Services [Return to top](#chap4)

The FTA has improved market conditions for U.S. corn against MERCOSUR competitors. The United States is poised to take advantage of TRQ preferences, in addition to quality and shipping cost differences to attract Colombian buyers. U.S. corn can take advantage of more competitive trade conditions against MERCOSUR corn, which is subject to a price band mechanism, where duties fluctuate based on a reference price.

####Opportunities [Return to top](#chap4)

Corn imports will increase in the following years due to: 1) a continued growth of the Colombian economy and a relatively strong Colombian peso; and, 2) a rising middle

88 class and shifting dietary patterns towards more animal protein that generates a significant demand for more animal feed to satisfy primarily the poultry and swine sectors.

The oilseed meal supply in Colombia is composed mainly of soybean meal, cottonseed meal, palm kernel meal, and sesame seed meal. All fishmeal used in the country is imported from Perú, Chile, and Ecuador. The FTA eliminated duties on all imports of U.S. soybeans and soybean meal. Primary competitors are MERCOSUR countries.

###SOYBEAN MEAL

![Soybean](images/soybean.png)

The oilseed meal supply in Colombia is composed mainly of soybean meal, cottonseed meal, palm kernel meal, and sesame seed meal. All fishmeal used in the country is imported from Perú, Chile, and Ecuador. The FTA eliminated duties on all imports of U.S. soybeans and soybean meal. Primary competitors are MERCOSUR countries.

####Best Prospects/Services [Return to top](#chap4)

Total domestic consumption of soybean meal and palm kernel meal are forecast to

make up 90 percent of Colombian vegetable meal used for animal feed production.

U.S. export market share of soybean meal to Colombia dramatically dropped to 5 percent against MERCOSUR countries in recent years. Zero duties and no quota under the FTA have greatly helped soybean meal exports recover and expand market share against competitors.

####Opportunities [Return to top](#chap4)

The FTA has created new opportunities for U.S. exporters and investment opportunities for new oilseed crushing facilities and feed manufacturing plants in Colombia. Soybean meal imports will continue to increase in the following years due to a rising middle class and shifting dietary patterns towards more animal protein that generates a significant demand for more animal feed to satisfy primarily the poultry and swine sectors.
