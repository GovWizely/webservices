<div id="soybean-meal-best-prospects">
Total domestic consumption of soybean meal and palm kernel meal are forecast to

make up 90 percent of Colombian vegetable meal used for animal feed production.

U.S. export market share of soybean meal to Colombia dramatically dropped to 5 percent against MERCOSUR countries in recent years. Zero duties and no quota under the FTA have greatly helped soybean meal exports recover and expand market share against competitors.
