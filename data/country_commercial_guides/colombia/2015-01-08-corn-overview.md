<div id="corn-overview">
Colombiaâ€™s yellow corn production is challenged by low productivity and is very susceptible to weather conditions and plant pests. As a result, about 60 percent of the market is satisfied by imports. Colombian imports of U.S. corn have fallen in recent years because of high prices and strong competition from MERCOSUR. Colombian corn demand is expected to increase because of growing feed needs from the Colombian poultry sector. Under the FTA, U.S. yellow and white corn are subject to a tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) to be phased out over 12 years.
