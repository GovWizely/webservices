Colombia has effective means for enforcing property and contractual rights through judicial proceedings.

**Real Property**

Secured interests in real property, and to a lesser degree movable property, are recognized and generally enforced after the property is properly registered. In terms of protecting third party purchasers, such as in the case cited under investment disputes, existing law is inadequate. The concept of a mortgage, trust deed, and other types of liens exists, as well as a reliable system of recording such secured interests. Deeds, however, have some legal risk due to the prevalence of transactions that have never been registered with the Public Instruments Registry. About 48 percent of rural land in Colombia, or about 1.7 million plots, does not have a clear title. The Colombian government is working to title these plots and has started a pilot formalization program for land restitution. Colombia scored 83 percent out of a hundred, or a “B,” for the ease of registering property according to the World Bank’s 2014 Doing Business Report.

**Intellectual Property Rights**

In Colombia, the grant, registration, and administration of intellectual property rights are carried out by four different government entities. The Superintendency of Industry and Commerce acts as the Colombian patent and trademark office. The Colombian Agricultural Institute is in charge of issuing plant variety protections and data protections for agricultural products. The Ministry of Interior administers copyrights through the National Copyright Directorate. The Ministry of Health and Social Protection handles

data protection for products registered through the National Food and Drug Institute. Each of these entities experiences significant financial and technical resource constraints. Colombia is subject to Andean Community Decision 486 on trade secret protection, which is fully implemented domestically by the Unfair Competition Law of 1996.

The patent regime in Colombia currently provides for a 20-year protection period for patents, a 10-year term for industrial designs, and 20 or 15-year protection for new plant varieties, depending on the species. However, U.S. companies have expressed concern that the Colombian government does not provide patent protection for new uses of previously known or patented products. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office partnered with the Superintendency of Industry and Commerce to establish a Patent Prosecution Highway (PPH) pilot program. The PPH allows for the mutual recognition of patent examination procedures making the patent granting process faster. The pilot program originally ended in August 2013, but was extended indefinitely due to its success.

Colombia has been on the U.S. Trade Representative’s Special 301 “Watch List” every year since 1991 and is also listed in the notorious markets report. Both reports can be found at [http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/reports-and-publications/2014](http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/reports-and-publications/2014). The FTA improved standards for the protection and enforcement of a broad range of intellectual property rights. Such improvements include state-of-the-art protections for digital products such as software, music, text, and videos; stronger protection for U.S. patents, trademarks and test data; and prevention of piracy and counterfeiting by criminalizing end-use piracy. Colombia is a member of the Inter -American Convention for Trademark and Commercial Protection. Various procedures associated with industrial property, patent, and trademark registration are available at [http://www.sic.gov.co/es/web/guest/propiedad-industrial](http://www.sic.gov.co/es/web/guest/propiedad-industrial). In August 2012, Colombia joined the Madrid Agreement Concerning the International Registration of Marks (Madrid Protocol). The Colombian government joined the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Trademark Law Treaty on January 13, 2012, which entered into force on April 12, 2013. WIPO’s 1996 Copyright Treaty has been in force since March 6, 2002, and the Performances and Phonograms Treaty since May 20, 2002. Colombia is not a member of the Patent Law Treaty.

On January 23, 2013, the Constitutional Court declared that Law 1520 of 2012, which was to implement several FTA-related commitments including copyrights, TV programming quotas, and IPR enforcement measures, was unconstitutional on procedural grounds. In response, the Santos administration presented separate bills to Congress. Although the copyrights law was reintroduced, it was struck down because it was not debated by Congress before the end of the legislative period and will need to be reintroduced in 2014. A draft copyrights bill is circulating now, including with the U.S. Trade Representative, for comment prior to resubmission to Congress. The TV programming quotas bill was approved in three of four required debates and must be voted on in a final debate scheduled this year. The IPR enforcement bill was approved in July 2013; however, it does not yet include criminal penalties and a specified list of damages for copyright infringement and trademark counterfeiting – crucial parts of the commitment. The FTA deadlines for these two portions of the IPR enforcement bills were May 15 and November 15, 2013, respectively.

While Colombia has taken steps to increase penalties to better protect intellectual property rights, pirated and falsified products are a major problem and are distributed through hundreds of stalls in flea markets. In 2006, amendments to the criminal code increased the maximum prison term for copyright infringement from five to eight years, with a corresponding rise in the minimum term from two to four years. The code also contains provisions on the violation of technological protection measures and rights management, both key obligations of the WIPO Treaties. Unfortunately, these violations are only punishable by fines. Although Colombia has one of the lowest software piracy rates in Latin America, piracy of both business and entertainment software continues to cause commercial harm to legitimate industry. Even with an improved penal code, law enforcement raids have not created a deterrent effect.
