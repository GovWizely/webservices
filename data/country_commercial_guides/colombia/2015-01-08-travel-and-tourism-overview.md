Due to steady GDP growth and increased economic stability, Colombia offers a promising market for the U.S. tourism industry. Colombia is expected to be one of the fastest growing countries in terms of number of visitors to the United States over the next 10 years, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA). Colombia ranks as the 16th top country for sending travelers to the United States. More than 735,000 Colombian travelers visited the United States in 2013, 22 percent more than in 2012.

The United States is the most popular overseas travel destination for Colombians, who, in 2013 spent about US$1.75 billion in the United States (excluding airfares) on food, car rental, hotel, sightseeing, and shopping. The length of stay for Colombians in the United States varies, but averages approximately seven nights; however, for those with relatives in the United States the average stay ranges from two to four weeks. The time of travel usually corresponds with school calendars and usually takes place from November to early February, during Easter week and from June to late August. On April 15, 2012, the U.S. State Department announced the validity increase of B -1 and B- 2 visit visas for Colombians traveling on a temporary basis to the United States from five years to ten years. Under these new rules, most Colombian applicants who qualify for a B- 1 or B-2 non-immigrant visa will be issued a 120-month, multiple- entry visa. Additionally, the U.S. government has increased its efforts in the visa process capacity in order to reduce visa interview wait times. This and the implementation of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (commonly referred to as the FTA) which was implemented on May 15, 2012, will foster a significant expansion of trade between the two countries that will result in the increase of Colombian business travelers visiting the United States.

Since the validity increase, of B-1 and B-2 visit visas for Colombians traveling on a temporary basis to the United States from five years to ten years, the number of Colombians traveling to the United States has increased significantly, with a 22 percent increase in 2013 over the previous year. It is expected that this increase will continue in the coming three to four years.

On May 10, 2011, Colombia and the United States signed an “Open Skies” air transport agreement. This agreement entered into force on January 1, 2013, encouraging several airlines to unveil plans to add services between the two countries in the next two years. During the transition period before the “Open Skies” agreement entered into force, each

country was allowed to add 21 additional weekly frequencies on currently operated routes and create new itineraries without restriction.

This Open Skies agreement will strengthen and expand the strong linkages between the two countries, benefiting U.S. and Colombian businesses and travelers by expanding air service and encouraging vigorous price competition by airlines, while safeguarding aviation safety and security. Airlines from the United States and Colombia will be allowed to select routes, destinations, and prices for both passenger and cargo service based on consumer demand and market conditions. This agreement will significantly increase air traffic between the two countries. Currently, 200 weekly flights operate between Colombia and the United States.

Five U.S. airlines provide direct daily flights between Colombia and the United States; Delta (from Atlanta and New York), United Airlines (from Houston and Newark), American Airlines (from Miami and Dallas), Spirit (from Fort Lauderdale) and Jet Blue (from Orlando and Fort Lauderdale). Avianca provides non-stop flights to Miami, Washington-Dulles, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and New York, and LAN also offers non-stop service from Colombia to Miami.

Most Colombians organize their trips through a local travel agent, and are known to be last-minute planners, especially to overseas destinations. The Internet has begun to affect the competitive balance in the travel and tourism industry, as it provides an efficient vehicle for information access, marketing, purchasing and paying for services. Most Colombian travel agents have developed their own travel websites to offer online flight booking, hotels and car rentals.

Colombians have significantly diversified their travel habits, selecting other countries for their vacation plans. South America, especially Argentina and Brazil, have become increasingly popular destinations. These destinations are attractive alternatives to the United States because there is no visa required and promotional packages that include low airfares and all-inclusive hotel or resort rates are readily available. The strong competition from alternative destinations makes it imperative for the U.S. Travel and Tourism industry in Colombia to consistently promote travel opportunities.
