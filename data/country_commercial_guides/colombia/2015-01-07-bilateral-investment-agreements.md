Colombia has nine free trade agreements that include investment chapters: the U.S., European Union, Canada, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, Andean Community of Nations (Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru), European Free Trade Area (only Switzerland and Liechtenstein have ratified), Mercosur (Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela), and North Triangle (El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala). Colombia has signed agreements with Israel, Panama, Costa Rica, and South Korea that are expected to be ratified and enter into force within the next two years. Free trade agreement negotiations with Turkey and Japan are ongoing and Colombiaâ€™s goal is to have sixteen trade agreements with over fifty countries (including the 27 EU members) by the end of 2014.

Additionally, Colombia has stand-alone bilateral investment treaties in force with China, India, Peru, Spain, and Switzerland and treaties signed but not in force with the UK and Japan. Colombia together with Chile, Mexico, and Peru form the Pacific Alliance, which signed a trade agreement in February 2014 that is expected to take effect sometime in 2015.

Colombia has double taxation agreements in force with Spain, Chile, Switzerland, and now Canada. It has signed agreements with India, Mexico, South Korea, and Portugal. Talks for such accords have concluded successfully with Belgium, the Czech Republic, and France. Colombia is currently negotiating double taxation agreements with Germany, the Netherlands, Japan, and the United States.
