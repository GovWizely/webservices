Not only can a greater number of Colombian students now afford to study in the United States, but newly created employment opportunities in Colombia also make American degrees even more valuable. International education is highly valued in Colombia. A recent survey of employers found that 58 percent preferred to hire people who had earned advanced degrees abroad.

The approval of the FTA has increased foreign investment and the need of academic mobility and exchange. This will result in the increase of the enrollment of Colombian students at American academic institutions in the foreseeable future.

Beyond the economic implications, the availability of educational services carries even greater significance in terms of improving general living conditions in Colombia. A well-educated Colombian population will be vital to the countryâ€™s economic growth and global competitiveness over the long term. U.S. educational services will also expose more Colombians to American culture, further strengthening ties between the two countries.

There are concrete opportunities to increase the number of Colombian students attending U.S. universities. Those wishing to attract Colombian students should consider actively increasing recruitment campaigns in order to raise their visibility. Financial Aid/scholarship opportunities and information on the process to obtain a U.S. student visa are essential topics for U.S. educational institutions when promoting themselves in Colombia.

In Colombia, there is a strong network of 11 Education USA centers administering language programs and doing extensive outreach around the country. Advising centers are located at 9 binational centers, the Fulbright commission and COLFUTURO.
