<h3 id="market-entry-strategy">Market Entry Strategy</h3>[Return to top](#chap1)

Market entry strategies are as follows:

Secure an agent, representative, or distributor in Colombia, which requires a contract that meets the provisions of the Colombian Commercial Code.

Focus on formality, personal relationships, and trust when negotiating agreements and contracts.

Communicate with the U.S. Commercial Service and the Economic sections of the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá regarding specific concerns.

Offer excellent after-sales service arrangements and maintain the sales relationship. Warranties or guarantees on imports are critical for supporting after sales service in Colombia.

Provide high quality products and/or services, affordable financing and competitive pricing. Support your local partner’s marketing efforts with advertising campaigns or by participating in trade shows. Do not be hands off; visit often. Spanish-language sales collateral and service manuals are essential, and may be required in certain sectors, like medical products. U.S.-based staff with a strong knowledge of Spanish is certainly helpful.
