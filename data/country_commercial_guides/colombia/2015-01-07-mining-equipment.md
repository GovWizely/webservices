The Colombian mining sector continues to be an important driver of the Colombian economy, increasing its share of the economy to 7.7 percent, or US$19 Billion, in 2012. Of this over 66 percent was coal production, which reached 89 million tons, up 19.4 percent from 2011. Further, the mining sector, together with the oil & gas sector, has attracted a large percentage of the nation’s direct foreign investment (about 21.5 percent). However, the drop of international prices of mining commodities and labor strikes at the country’s top two coal producers have reduced the expected production targets for 2013, from 94 million tons to less than 86 million tons. This is also true for other products such as nickel, gold, silver, and other minerals. Industry sources estimate that during 2013 the mining sector decreased by 6 percent compared to 2012.

In addition to market conditions, the extensive delays in the review of old or new environmental license requests (requests are currently taking three times as long as they did in 2006) by the National Environmental Licensing Authority (ANLA), have severely affected the development of large transportation infrastructure, mining, and oil & gas projects. The Government of Colombia (GOC) is actively working with private sector companies to identify ways to streamline the process, reduce procedural bottlenecks and allow for a more predictable process.

The GOC’s National Mining Agency (ANM) continues to review license-holders that are not actively developing projects to develop a future auction of mining blocks within the recently created national strategic reserve of 20 million hectares of area that are known to contain key minerals such as gold, copper, and other minerals.

The GOC is also working with the Colombian Congress to review the current national mining code and National Mining Development Plan (PNDM) to attract new mining investors. The ANM and geological survey (Ingeominas) are developing an exploration plan to cover more than 120,000 square kilometers of geologically promising areas, including geophysical and geo-chemical prospecting that could allow a better understanding of mineral potential and attract private partners.

Colombia has proven coal reserves of 6.6 billion metric tons, and up to an additional 4.5 billion metric tons of indicated reserves. This represents about 40 percent of the reserves in Latin America, and ranks number 10 in the world. Since 2002, production levels have expanded 88 percent to reach more than 85 million tons in 2012. Estimates suggest production could reach 140 million tons per year by 2019. Precious metals production, especially gold and silver, has increased more than 11 percent per year to 55.9 tons (gold) and 24 tons (silver) between 2004-2011. Companies such as AngloGold Ashanti, B2 Gold, Continental Gold, and Gran Colombia Gold, among others, are developing feasibility studies or applying for exploration licenses.

Imports of mining equipment benefit from Colombia’s relative proximity to the United States. And, with the implementation of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (FTA) which went into effect on May 15th 2012, Colombia will eliminate import duties for equipment, spare parts, and accessories destined for various mining activities (production, processing, and transformation).
