In academic year 2012/2013, 6,543 Colombian students traveled to the United States to study. That constitutes a 3.9 percent increase over the previous year.

The U.S. Embassy in Bogota supports efforts to increase the number of Colombian students studying in the United States by supporting technology projects such as Ed, a 24/7 virtual adviser in Spanish and various micro scholarships for English Language learning. The approval of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (FTA) has increased foreign investment and the need of academic mobility and exchange.

Additionally, President Obama launched the initiative “100,000 Strong in the Americas,” in March 2011, which intends to increase the number of Latin American students studying in the United States and the number of U.S. students studying in Latin America. The U.S. Commercial Service in cooperation with the Education USA offices in Colombia has supported various education fairs that included the participation of U.S. boarding schools, universities and ESL institutions, in order to promote their programs in Colombia.

Given the demands of modern day society, the number of Colombian undergraduate and graduate students in the United States is increasing slowly. Colombians know it is difficult to obtain a high level position within the government or an important national or multinational company without proficient English skills and/or a Masters Degree. The most demanding field of studies are those focused on business administration, management, finance, banking, marketing, and engineering.

Under government-to-government or private agreements, both public and private universities in Colombia have developed programs with universities in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Priority is given to projects that foster post-graduate programs for training professors as well as research to enhance teaching.


Most scholarships are awarded through two institutions, one of which is the Colombian Institute for Educational Loans and Technical Studies Abroad (ICETEX, by its initials in Spanish), which is dedicated to finance higher education through the system of payback financial aid that allows students to start or continue their higher education either in country or abroad. During 2013 ICETEX awarded 837 scholarships for Master’s and PhD programs. The second institution is COLFUTURO, which is a non-profit organization that provides funds to Colombian professionals/students to study abroad. Their loan program is available to students who have been accepted to graduate programs at foreign universities. During 2013 COLFUTURO awarded 1,112 scholarships: 956 for Master’s programs and 156 for PhD programs. Overall, 246 of those scholarships were for programs in the United States.

COLFUTURO also has agreements with many universities such as: Carnegie Mellon - Heinz College, Columbia, Duke, Johnson School of Management - Cornell University, Kogod School of Business - American University, The Krannert School of Management - Purdue University, Tulane University, and Harvard University.
