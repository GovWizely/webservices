As with any market, there remain challenges to doing business in Colombia (some of which were eliminated with the implementation of the FTA). Several are listed below:

Colombia has struggled with the requirements of the existing government procurement framework, which calls for open bidding in public tenders. As such there can be a lack of transparency, fairness, and truly competitive bidding conditions in many tenders.

Only firms licensed under Colombian law may provide legal services. Foreign law firms can operate in Colombia by forming a joint venture with a Colombian law firm and operating under the licenses of the Colombian lawyers in the firm. Economic needs tests are required when foreign providers of professional services operate temporarily; and residency requirements restrict trans-border trade of certain professional services, such as accounting, bookkeeping, auditing, architecture, engineering, urban planning, and medical and dental services.

A commercial presence is required to provide information processing services or to bid on Colombian government contracts. Telecommunications barriers to entry include cross subsidies, the requirement for a commercial presence in Colombia, and an economic needs tests.

For firms with more than ten employees, no more than 10 percent of the general workforce and 20 percent of specialists may be foreign nationals.

International banking institutions are required to maintain a commercial presence in Colombia through subsidiary offices. Insurance companies are restricted from offering policies to underwrite risk on government sponsored infrastructure projects due to Colombian regulations that do not recognize insurance policies as equivalent to bank guarantees.

Colombia has been on the Special 301 “Watch List” every year since 1991, reflecting ongoing challenges in the enforcement of intellectual property rights.

Customs duties have been consolidated into four tariff levels: 0 to 5 percent on capital goods and industrial goods and raw materials not produced in Colombia, 10 percent on manufactured goods with some exemptions, and 15 to 20 percent on consumer and “sensitive” goods. Exceptions include automobiles, which are subject to a 35 percent duty. A group of agricultural products is protected by a price band mechanism that offers variable duties as high as 100 percent. The majority of U.S. made products are not subject to an import duty due to the FTA. The duties for some products are being phased out over a period of up to ten years. For these products the duty is being reduced each year until it becomes zero.
