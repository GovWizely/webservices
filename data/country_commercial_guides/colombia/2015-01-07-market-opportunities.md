On the other side of the ledger, Colombia provides significant opportunities for U.S. exporters:

Colombia's extensive, planned infrastructure projects will require: project financing, public works subcontracting, logistics, construction equipment for public roads and airports; water treatment, water supply, electric power generation, oil and gas exploration and pollution control equipment, air navigational and port security aids, railway construction, transportation equipment, security and defense items and services, and mass transit systems. The city of Bogota is in the early process of developing a metro and continues to expand its bus rapid system.

Awarded to OPAIN in 2006, Bogotá’s El Dorado International Airport still requires massive upgrades. The Medellin/Rio Negro airport upgrade is underway and the Northeast airports concession has been awarded. All concessionaires are seeking equipment to modernize their facilities. The United States Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) and EXIM Bank support U.S. companies as they craft solutions to development challenges and make inroads in key sectors such as oil and gas, petrochemicals, renewable energy, telecommunications, and ports. USTDA grants have resulted in big U.S. company wins at the country’s two refineries. EXIM’s preliminary commitment of US$ 1 billion to Ecopetrol and US$ 2.8 billion to Reficar for its refinery project will provide a myriad of export opportunities for U.S. exporters of oil and gas equipment and services. USTDA grants for customs security and operational enhancements at the ports in Cartagena, Buenaventura, and Puerto Salgar should also increase prospects for U.S. exporters.

Significant U.S. export opportunities not already mentioned include: cotton, wheat, corn soy products, automotive parts and accessories, tourism, computer hardware and software services, IT equipment and services, plastics materials and resins, electrical power systems, safety and security equipment, food and

beverage processing and packaging equipment, medical equipment, oil and gas equipment, mining equipment, franchising, and education.
