General Overview

Colombia’s telecommunications market continues to be driven by Government programs aimed at increasing access and penetration. The broadest coverage can be found in the mobile telephony segment, where there are 48.6 million registered lines (in a country of approximately 46.5 million inhabitants), of which approximately 79 percent work through prepaid services, according to the latest MinTIC quartlerly report (3Q2013).

In Colombia, mobile Internet is also directly connected to prepaid users, which jumped from just 2.5 million at the beginning of 2010 to 13.8 million by the third quarter of 2013. Subscription Internet services grew dynamically as well, reaching 4 million for the same time period, from just below 1 million in 2010.

For fixed services, the drop in telephony lines has stabilized, with a total number of 6.7 million lines by October 2013, and a penetration rate of approximately 13.5 percent by November 2012.

Television has continued to move in an upward trend, with approximately 33 percent of households having some type of paid subscription service at the end of 2012.

One of the most important developments in the telecommunications sector in 2013 was the spectrum auction organized by the GOC to allow carriers to provide 4G/LTE services. Under this process 60 Mhz in the 2,500 MHz band were awarded to Claro and DirecTV (30 MHz each), while Avantel, ETB/Tigo and Movistar were awarded spectrum in the AWS band, in a process estimated at approximately US$400 million.

Furthermore, the process for a third nationwide public channel to be assigned is still to be resolved, with more frequencies allocated for local channels during the year, while the National Television Agency is promoting the establishment of new subscription TV companies to take advantage of the new fiber optic infrastructure.

Telecommunications and the FTA

On May 15, 2012 the FTA went into effect, including a chapter dealing with telecommunication services specifically. This chapter regulates access to the use of public telecommunication services for both parties; it stipulates a series of obligations pertaining to suppliers of public telecommunication services, including interconnection, resale of services, number portability, and dialing parity; and obligations for major suppliers of telecommunications services, such as treatment by major suppliers, competitive safeguards, resale of services, unbundling of network elements, interconnection provisions, co- location, provisioning and pricing of leased circuits services, and access to poles, ducts, conduits and rights of way.

The FTA Telecommunications chapter also regulates operation of submarine cable systems, establishes conditions for the supply of information services, the operation of independent regulatory bodies and government-owned telecommunications suppliers, and the resolution of telecommunications disputes, among others. In general, the Telecommunications chapter fosters transparency, equal treatment and a clear framework for U.S. companies operating in Colombia and vice versa.

In September 2012 Colombia’s Communications Regulatory Commission (CRC) published a study of the regulatory and market effects of the FTA on the telecommunications market. In general terms, the conclusions were that Colombia could expect to benefit from the agreement in both the retail and wholesale markets, as new players enter the country, and new investments are required to improve network quality and broaden end-user services. The study further concluded that Colombia had taken all

56 legislative and regulatory steps to comply with what was negotiated under the agreement.
