Colombia is the 22nd largest market for U.S. medical equipment exports. During 2012, the United States exported US$365.6 million in medical equipment to Colombia. The medical device market relies on imports for around 80 percent of the market. Since the signing of the United States- Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (commonly referred to as the FTA) in 2012, 96 percent of U.S. Medical equipment exports to Colombia receive duty free treatment.

The Colombian medical device market was valued at US$1.2 billion in 2013, ranking fourth in Latin America. It is one of the world's ten fastest growing medical device markets. The market is expected to almost double in value in the next five years, reaching US$2.2 billion in 2018.

Due to the 1993 health care reform, also known as Law 100, Colombia benefits from one of the most extensive insurance systems and medical financial protection in Latin America, second only to Chile. This reform created the social security system and covers standards governing the general system of pensions, workplace injury insurance and complementary social services. Currently approximately 80 percent of the Colombian population is covered by health insurance, and the Government of Colombia (GOC) sees universal health insurance coverage as a goal.

The country’s healthcare infrastructure is adequate in the larger urban areas, but is in need of modernization. The healthcare system is complex, and coverage is not yet universal. Currently the Colombian Congress is working to develop an updated health care reform law, which they expect would modernize the system.

According to Espicom (A Bussiness Monitor International Company for Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals) “the Colombian medical device market has benefitted from the country's increasing political stability and GDP growth above the Latin American average in recent years. It now ranks fourth in Latin America and is projected to register one of

the world's top 10 fastest 2013- 2018 medical device CAGRs (Compound Annual Growth Rate). Per capita medical device expenditure is low but healthcare and regulatory developments implemented over the last three years will provide new growth opportunities for medical device companies in the long-term. Multinationals that already have a presence in the Latin American market will have a distinct advantage over new entrants.”

According to a study by America Economia Intelligence, seven of the twenty best hospitals and clinics in Latin America in 2013 were located in Colombia. In fourth place is the Fundacion Valle del Lili in Cali, in sixth is Fundacion Cardioinfantil in Bogota, in eighth Fundacion Cardiovascular de Colombia in Bucaramanga, in tenth Hospital Pablo Tobon in Medellin, in fourteenth Centro Medico Imbanaco in Cali, in nineteenth Clinica las Americas in Medellin, and in twentieth Hospital San Ignacio de Bogota.

U.S. imports enjoy the largest share of the Colombian market, accounting for around a third of all medical equipment imports. Currently the strongest competitors are China, Germany and Japan. China is quickly increasing market share. With the May 2012 implementation of the FTA, tariffs on 96 percent of U.S. medical equipment exports to Colombia went from an average of 7.6 percent (ranging from zero up to 15 percent) to zero. Colombia also has FTAs with our leading medical device producers such as the European Union and Canada.

Intellectual Property Rights:

The FTA requires high levels of intellectual property protection and enforcement, consistent with U.S. and international standards, and will support the growth of trade in valuable digital and other intellectual property-based products. The FTA also provides enhanced protections for trademarks, copyrights, and patents, such as the implementation of a Colombian electronic trademark application system and on-line database, prohibition on the circumvention of technological protection measures used by copyright holders, and requirements for the parties to provide robust patent and test data protection.
