Best prospects for U.S. medical equipment manufacturers include:

* Medical, surgical, dental and veterinary instruments
* Electro-diagnostic apparatus
* Orthopedics devices
* Prosthetic devices
* Diagnostic imaging equipment
* Laboratory equipment and consumables
* Ultrasound, mammography and cardiovascular equipment.
* Dermatological and laser treatment apparatus and apparel (boosted by medical tourism and expanding plastic surgery demand)
* Intensive care, cardiology, neurology and oncology related equipment

It is expected that a number of Colombiaâ€™s clinical laboratories will be upgraded in the near future, which will provide an opportunity for exporters of clinical laboratory equipment. Opportunities also remain in medical, surgical, dental and veterinary instruments and electro medical equipment.
