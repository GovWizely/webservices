U.S. companies bidding on major government, or even private sector, projects/procurement and those entering into joint ventures or other long-term contractual arrangements should seek local legal advice. Also, companies that are concerned about the protection of intellectual property such as trademarks, copyrights, and patents should also seek legal counsel before entering the Colombian market.

There are a number of good Colombian law firms that specialize in various aspects of commercial law. Additionally, a number of major U.S. firms who operate internationally have affiliate arrangements in Colombia. Several legal and business services providers in Colombia are found on the U.S. Commercial Serviceâ€™s website: [http://export.gov/colombia/businessserviceproviders/index.asp](http://export.gov/colombia/businessserviceproviders/index.asp)
