On May 15, 2014, the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (FTA) will celebrate its two year anniversary. Thanks to the FTA, road and railroad construction equipment (which were previously assessed an average tariff of 15 percent) currently enter the Colombian market duty-free. Services such as project management, bridge design, architecture and engineering design, among others, also have advantages as a result of the FTA.

Other benefits of the FTA include strong protection for U.S. investors (legal stability in which Colombia ranks 6th in the world), expanded access to the services market, greater intellectual property rights protection, market access for remanufactured goods, increased transparency and improved dispute settlement mechanisms (arbitration). Under the National Treatment Caveat, Chapter 9 of the FTA, U.S. companies must be treated as locals when they participate on public bids, eliminating the disadvantage they used to face prior to the signing of the agreement. The one exception to this is with regard to public bids issued by the Colombian Civil Aviation Authority (AEROCIVL), which was excluded from the FTA.

As opportunities are concentrated in road construction, airport expansion, railroad construction and port expansion through concessions with the GOC and through 4G PPP contracts based on the Public Private Partnership (PPP) law, it is recommended that American firms interested in offering services to construction companies in Colombia understand how the PPP scheme works, and partner with Colombian companies by offering their goods or services.
