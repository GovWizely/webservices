The total number of passengers traveling from Colombia to foreign countries increased by 15 percent between 2008 and 2012. From 2012 to 2013 the number of travelers grew approximately 22 percent. The growth rate for 2014 is expected to increase by 15 percent. There are positive factors that will help Colombia to augment the number of travelers going abroad for business and tourism purposes such as: (a) the “Open Skies” agreement which entered in force in January 2013 (b) the implementation of the FTA;

(c) the validity increase of B-1 and B-2 visit visas for Colombians going to United States from five to ten years (d) the implementation of trade agreements between Colombia and other countries, including Mercosur, Central America, Asia, Canada and the European Union.

The increasing flow of foreign passengers coming to Colombia is creating a growing demand for hotel services. Several major international hotel chains have started construction of new facilities. Marriott opened a new hotel in Cali and plans to open one in Medellin in 2015 and two more in the following three years. Hilton plans to open six hotels in other cities (Barranquilla, Cartagena, and Medellin); Holiday Inn plans to open three new hotels in Bogota, Barranquilla and Cartagena; Tryp and Wyndham opened a new hotel in Bogota and plan to open 43 hotels in Colombia in the next three years with the brands Days Inn and Super 8. Additionally, Sonesta, Hyatt, and Decameron have announced their plans to build hotels in the cities of Bogotá, Medellin, Cali and Cartagena, 52 new hotels (4,600 rooms) are expected to be completed by 2017. During the period 2004 – 2012, the hotel industry investments increased from US$ 24 million in 2004 to US$ 2.2 billion in 2012.

According to ProExport, a federal agency to attract investment to Colombia, local governments offer incentives in the form of an income tax exemption for a period of 30 years for new hotels constructed and/or expanded between 2003 and December 31, 2017. Also, ecotourism services will receive this benefit for 20 years, which began in 2003.

This means that the companies which benefit from these incentives will pay a 0 percent income tax rate for a period of time and once that term is over they will be subject to the general tax rate, which is 33 percent.

Other incentives:

* Tax duty exemption and VAT deferral on Capital Goods used for tourism exports
* Legal Stability Agreements to guarantee investment projects
* Tax discounts by hiring new employees under 28, handicapped, displaced, or women over 40
