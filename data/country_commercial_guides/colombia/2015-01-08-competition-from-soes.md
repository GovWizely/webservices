**OECD Guidelines on Corporate Governance of SOEs**

At Colombia’s request, the OECD analyzed Colombia’s corporate governance practices of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) against OECD Guidelines and released a report in December 2013 ([http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/colombian-soes-a-review-against-the-oecd-guidelines-on-corporate-governance-of-state-owned-enterprises_5k3v1ts5s4f6-en](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/colombian-soes-a-review-against-the-oecd-guidelines-on-corporate-governance-of-state-owned-enterprises_5k3v1ts5s4f6-en)). The OECD found that Colombia’s legal framework is compatible with the OECD standards of corporate governance. Colombian SOEs fall into two broad categories: Industrial and Commercial State Companies that are statutory corporations wholly owned by the state and whose origin and norms are established by law and Mixed-Ownership in which the state has a stake and which can take any legal form and are generally governed by the norms applicable to the private sector. The central government owns 70 SOEs and partial SOEs. SOEs exist in the following sectors: defense article production, regional utility companies, postal service, electricity generation and distribution, hospitals, airports, banking, television, education, regional lotteries, alcohol and spirit distillers, and oil and gas.

In principle Colombia’s SOEs do not receive preferential treatment, though in practice some issues arise such as political authorities running SOEs and conflicts of interest. In general, Colombian SOEs are subject to the general legal framework and receive special treatment in very few areas. One of these areas is bankruptcy law; SOEs are largely protected from insolvency due to the necessity of providing essential public services. Colombian SOEs are, in general, subject to private law and structured as commercial companies. However, depending on the sector, SOEs may also be subject to specific sector norms, such as the Utilities Law.

Private enterprises generally are allowed to compete with public enterprises under the same terms and conditions, although at the sub-national level private liquor companies face licensing restrictions and other administrative barriers that prevent free competition with local SOEs. Private enterprises are allowed to compete with SOEs under the same terms and conditions with respect to access to markets, credit, and other business operations, such as licenses and supplies. State-owned banks are expected to treat SOEs without any preference. Colombian SOEs generally use the financial markets for financing and do not receive additional support from the government except in very rare cases.

Colombia’s corporate governance code is comprised of 41 best practices for shareholders’ meetings, boards of directors, disclosure of financial and non-financial information, and dispute resolution. Adoption of the code is voluntary and based on the principle of self-regulation, but Colombia requires that all companies submit an annual report on their implementation with a “comply or explain” approach. In March 2014, Santos signed a new law requiring all SOEs to make their operations publicly available. Colombia protects the rights of minority shareholders and allows any group of shareholders with less than a ten percent stake to request the intervention of the regulator if they believe the company is taking measures detrimental to their interests. According to the OECD, the three largest SOEs, Ecopetrol, ISA, and ISAGEN, are

considered to be good examples of professional management, competition, and excellent corporate governance.

**Sovereign Wealth Funds**

Colombia started operating a sovereign wealth fund in 2012 using royalties from the extractive industry. The fund’s main objective is to promote saving and economic stabilization in the country, but it also aims to boost productivity in Colombia through new technologies and innovation. The fund is administrated by the Central Bank.
