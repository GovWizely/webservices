<h4 id="medical-equipment-opportunities">Opportunities</h4>

In 2012 Colombia imported medical equipment and supplies valued at US$1.02 billion, the highest level ever. Of this total, US$359 million was from the United States. The medical device industry is concentrated around the capital of Bogota. Per capita spending on medical devices is average for the region. While there is some domestic capacity for manufacturing basic items, the medical device market is heavily reliant on imports, especially for more high-tech items. A few multinationals manufacture within the country.

In addition, Colombia is seriously promoting the country as a health destination (Health/Medical Tourism). Colombia is well known in Latin America and the rest of the world as a pioneer and leader in health services, positioning the country as one of the most attractive destinations to receive medical treatments. This becomes an important market opportunity for the United States because the success of this industry requires high quality standards, technology and infrastructure. This has led Colombian hospital and clinic management to upgrade existing facilities, adding/renewing medical equipment and providing English language training for their staff.

The best approach to enter into this market is through distributors, as companies really prefer to buy from someone located in Colombia that can provide after-sales services when needed. Although distribution and sales of imported medical equipment in Colombia is handled principally through importers, distributors, representatives, and agents, an increasing percentage of materials, supplies, and equipment, is imported directly by end-users. U.S. manufacturers should maintain close contact with end-users and provide training and demonstrations so end-users can familiarize themselves with the equipment. This strategy is being used effectively in Colombia by European and Japanese manufacturers.

**Registration Process**

U.S. companies should be aware that medical devices require registration at the “Instituto Nacional de Vigilancia de Medicamentos y Alimentos” (INVIMA), the country’s medical device regulator. It is strongly recommended that U.S. companies process the registration under their name and not under the local distributor name, as if it is listed under the local distributor name, the U.S. company will not be able to change or add distributors, during the lifetime of the registration, which is ten years. Classification of devices in Colombia follows a four-tiered risk model (Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb and Class III). Colombia’s device classification scheme is similar to those of the European Union and other Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) systems. If the device falls into a lower-risk category in Colombia (Class I or IIa), the company may qualify for an expedited review process and achieve market entry in a shorter time.

INVIMA is working on new medical device regulations that are expected to be released in 2014.

Access to this market is not easy for newcomers. The market is mature and competitive, with many foreign firms selling medical equipment and medical products. It should be noted that registration procedures can often be challenging and may pose a barrier to entry into this market.

Here are three firms that do product registration.
