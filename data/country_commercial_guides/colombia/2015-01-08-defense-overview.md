Colombia’s internal and external defense and security structure includes the Army, Navy (includes Marines and Coast Guard), Air Force, and the National Police. The total military spending increased from US$ 14.7 billion in 2012 to US$ 15.1 billion in 2013 7 (this figure includes, not only hardware investment indicated in the tables above, but also the addition of other budgets such as all cost related to the functioning of military forces, the police, their public benefits, the functioning of Satena Airlines, military housing, and other costs). The total military spending has been on average 3.7 percent of the country’s total GDP (2009 to 2013)8. Under Plan Colombia, significant U.S. funding, technical assistance, and equipment support has been provided to Colombian- led counter narcotic programs for drug eradication and interdiction, and expansion of the capacity of Colombian military and police. The current format of Plan Colombia expired in 2012, with the consequent nationalization of military programs by the Colombian government. For 2014 some spending may shift to drug eradication and peace keeping programs, especially if the peace negotiations that are currently undergoing with the FARC Rebel forces in Cuba are achieved. Despite the peace negotiations process, the Colombian government is expected to continue military actions and spending to fight

narco-terrorism, and gain security area through its police force, especially to develop security surveillance and enforcement in remote and isolated regions of the country.

Through the Foreign Military Sales Trust Fund, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) provides equipment and training to the Colombian military and police through military assistance programming. The Department of State (DOS), military sales, and the international narcotics control program are other sources of funding. The Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs has been the main source of funding for equipment acquisition in Colombia since 1990, through private military consulting firms. These firms operate through an open market competitive bidding system. However, U.S. funding is expected to significantly decrease at a rate of 10 percent per annum over the next five years. The Colombian congress approved Law 80 of 1993, under which procurement of goods and services for security and national defense made in Colombia by local manufacturers, must be purchased over goods made by foreign manufacturers and exporters9. However, under the National Treatment Caveat, Chapter 9 United States-Colombia bilateral trade agreement (FTA), U.S. companies must be treated as locals when they participate on public bids eliminating the disadvantage they used to face prior to the signing of the agreement.

In 2002, the Colombian government created a Wealth Tax to collect US$ 800 million from large companies and wealthy individuals, 70 percent of which was used to increase 2002-2003 defense spending. A similar tax in 2007- 2011 collected close to US$ 3.7 billion, of which a significant portion funded defense spending. The Colombian Army receives 60 percent of the funding, followed by the Air Force with 25 percent and the National Police with 10 percent.

The United States has had a privileged relationship with Colombia in regards to military equipment acquisitions; however, new competitors from England, France, South Korea, and Spain have gained some notoriety. The Colombian military tends to use standardized equipment and values relationships, trust and familiarity with equipment (as exemplified by their consistent use of the same type of rifles). However, foreign manufacturers are gaining market share. According to the unofficial estimates, U.S. imports represent close to 50 percent of the total imports of military equipment.

The Colombian military keeps high standards for its equipment, which historically was a great opportunity for American products. However, the United States could lose market share in the future due to pricing and more competitive bidding from foreign manufacturers. U.S. manufactured equipment is already losing market share for personal arms, with more rifles currently being bought from Australia, Belgium and Russia. Additional examples of non U.S. military products being used in Colombia include: British-made Hoover Crafts, French 105mm Obuses, and local Colombian manufacturing of various products including aluminum flat boats.
