The number of franchises in Colombia has more than doubled over the past 10 years. This boom has been driven by a better understanding and acceptance of the concept of franchising by many local firms, and by the improvement in international perception of the business environment due to the implementation of newly-signed free trade agreements.

After a pilot project of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and ten Colombian Chambers of Commerce to foster the development of franchising from 2006 through 2009, an ever growing number of companies have adopted franchising as a safe and less complex way of expanding their business.

According to industry sources, during 2012 the franchise sector grew by 13 percent when compared with the previous year. This trend is estimated to have continued through 2013, with year-to-date growth as of June estimated at 6 percent, and forecasts for the whole year at approximately 10 percent. Growth in the number of franchised concepts went from 427 registered brands in 2011, to 483 brands at the close of 2012. By mid-June of 2013, this number stood at 513, trailing Brazil (>2000), Mexico (>1000) and Argentina (563), but considerably ahead of Peru (268), Costa Rica (215), and Chile (142).

International concepts have increased vis-a-vis national franchising concepts, with the former taking up 57.5 percent of the total share of businesses, and the latter decreasing from 51 percent to 42.5 percent in 2011. The breakdown by country of origin of

international franchises in Colombia has the United States at the lead, with 22.3 percent of the total. Next come European countries such as Spain (7.2 percent), Italy (5.4 percent), England (2.8 percent) and France (2.6 percent); as well as a few Latin American countries such as Argentina (2.2 percent) and Brazil (1.8 percent).

By sector, the largest share of franchising concepts in 2013 was found in the clothing and fashion industry, with approximately 25 percent of the total. Specialty stores came in second place (11.4 percent), followed by fast food (approximately 8 percent), and restaurants and bars (7.3 percent).

There is a high concentration of franchise retailers in Colombia’s three major population centers (Bogota, Medellín and Cali), leaving a lot of potential for franchise development in other important cities with populations of or around 1 million people, such as Barranquilla, Cartagena, Bucaramanga and the three cities within what is called the coffee region (Armenia, Manizales, and Pereira).

In general terms, the concept of franchising in Colombia is yet to obtain the same degree of development as it has in developed countries such as the United States. However, as Colombia’s economic fundamentals have held stable and continue to improve, the outlook for franchising in Colombia is decidedly positive. Over the last decade, Colombia’s GDP per capita increased from just over $6,000 in 2000 to well over $10,000 by 2012. It is also estimated that the middle class grew from approximately 15 percent of the population in 2002 to 29 percent as of mid-June 2013. This amounts to almost 14 million people out of Colombia’s total 47 million inhabitants. It is estimated that only 3 percent of the Colombian population is in the high income bracket, which explains why Colombia, like many other Latin American markets, is a very price sensitive market. Familiarity with international franchising concepts remains closely correlated with income bracket, with only the higher brackets being familiar with newer and more novel concepts. Still, while the group with stronger purchasing power is more likely to adopt foreign concepts, some franchising concepts have demonstrated how they can quickly gain market appeal in the lower demographics by offering good products with interesting discounts.

In terms of intellectual property, Colombia has in place adequate institutions to guarantee the rights of companies that have been diligent in the registry of their brands and other intellectual property. There are no specific regulations pertaining specifically to the enforcement of franchising activities and agreements, which are regulated by Commercial Law and treated as “mercantile contracts” (Contrato Mercantil).

As Colombia’s economy is expected to continue growing at a stable and dynamic rate, it is very likely that franchising will continue to develop, both in terms of national and foreign concepts. Furthermore, with the increase in the development of new shopping centers in intermediate cities, growth is likely to benefit both established and up and coming players.

In terms of outlook by franchising category, food and beverages will continue to benefit the most from current economic trends, followed by clothing retail concepts. Services franchises are just starting to gain traction and have yet to become an attractive business opportunity for most investors, with the largest share found in the specialized services (7 percent), health (4 percent), and education and training (3 percent) categories.
