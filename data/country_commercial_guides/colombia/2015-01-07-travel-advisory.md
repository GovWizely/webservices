So that travelers can make an informed decision, the State Department provides risk assessments related to on-going violence, dangers and unrest that could affect U.S. citizens in various countries around the world. There is currently a State Department travel warning in effect for U.S. citizens planning travel to Colombia. For the latest security information, Americans traveling abroad should regularly monitor the Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs’ website at [http://travel.state.gov](http://travel.state.gov) where the current Worldwide Caution Public Announcement, Travel Warnings and Public Announcements can be found.

On October 14, 2014, the State Department issued a travel warning for Colombia, due to sporadic violence that continues to affect various parts of the country, including but not limited to narco-terrorist group attacks, kidnappings, petty crime and similar threats which have affected U.S. citizens. The travel warning can be found at:http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings/colombia-travel-warning.html For more information on a particular business travel plan, companies are urged to contact the Commercial Service, U.S. Embassy, Bogota for customized advice.

Most business persons who visit Colombia travel primarily to the major cities and commercial centers of Bogota, Cali, Medellín, Barranquilla and Cartagena, where caution should be taken against common large-city crimes such as pick pocketing, jewelry and purse-snatching, and currency scams. Selecting a good hotel, keeping valuables in a hotel safe, using authorized taxis and hired car services, and using common sense in avoiding certain areas of town will help to reduce the risk of falling victim to these crimes. At airports, care should be taken with hand luggage and travel documents.

Travel between cities should be by air in order to avoid rural areas controlled by terrorist groups and common criminals. Road travel outside of the major cities is not recommended.

Those who absolutely must travel to facilities in outlying areas (most commonly oil and mining professionals and technicians) are advised to adhere strictly to the security regulations and guidelines established by their companies.

For further information concerning travel to Colombia, U.S. travelers should consult the Department of State's latest Travel Warning and the Country-Specific Information.
