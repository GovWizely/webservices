**Consumer Oriented Products**

<h4 id="agricultural-sector-overview">Overview</h4>

Demand in Colombia for consumer oriented and other high-value food products has been growing steadily since the early 1990s. Specific products showing an increase in sales since then are red meat, fresh/frozen pork, mechanically de-boned chicken meat, hatching eggs, fresh fruits, processed fruits and vegetables, pet food, beer, nursery products, and various types of snacks and prepared foods. The main conditions that support the rise of consumer oriented product trade include: Colombiaâ€™s consistent annual economic growth above 4 percent, an expanding middle class, falling poverty, and changing consumer tastes and preferences.
