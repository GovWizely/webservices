**Legal System, Specialized Courts, Judicial Independence, Judgments of Foreign Courts**

The judicial system generally operates without government interference. It is procedurally and substantively fair and reliable, though competency can vary depending on the basic substantive knowledge of judges. In 2012, Law 1564 gave the Superintendency of Industry and Commerce, National Copyrights Directorate, and Colombian Agriculture Institute authority to judge civil commercial cases about intellectual property rights (IPR).

**Bankruptcy**

Colombia’s 1991 Constitution grants the Colombian government the authority to intervene directly in financial or economic affairs, and this authority provided solutions similar to U.S. Chapter 11 filings for companies facing liquidation or bankruptcy. Colombia’s bankruptcy regulations have two major objectives: to regulate proceedings to ensure creditors’ protection and monitor the efficient recovery and preservation of still-viable companies. This was revised in 2006 to allow creditors to request judicial liquidation, which replaces the previous forced auctioning option. Now, inventories are valued, creditors’ rights are taken into account, and either a direct sale takes place within two months or all assets are assigned to creditors based on their share of the company’s liabilities. The insolvency regime for companies was again revised in 2010 to make proceedings more agile and flexible and allow debtors to enter into a long-term payment agreement with creditors, giving the company a chance to recover and continue operating. Bankruptcy is not criminalized in Colombia.

Restructuring proceedings aim to protect the debtors from bankruptcy. Once reorganization has begun, creditors cannot use collection proceedings to collect on debts owed prior to the beginning of the reorganization proceedings. All existing creditors at the moment of the reorganization are recognized during the proceedings if they present their credit. Foreign creditors, equity shareholders including foreign equity shareholders, and holders of other financial contracts, including foreign contract holders, are recognized during the proceeding. Established creditors are guaranteed a vote in the final decision.

**Investment Disputes**

There is one pending investment dispute currently in litigation since 1999 involving a U.S. fast food company. The company purchased land to build a restaurant, and after the restaurant was in operation the Colombian courts seized the land. The government seized the property during an investigation of the prior landholder for drug trafficking and money laundering under the assumption that it was acquired using drug money.


International Arbitration, ICSID Convention, and New York Convention

Foreign judgments are recognized and enforced in Colombia through an application submitted to the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court. The arbitration process in Colombia was improved in 2012 when new legislation based on the UNCITRAL Model Law was adopted. The new statute stipulates that awards be governed by not only the new law but also international conventions (New York Convention, Panama Convention, etc.), which has made the process easier for the parties involved. Arbitration in Colombia is completely independent from judiciary proceedings, and once arbitration has begun, the only competent authority is the arbitration tribunal itself. The CTPA protects U.S. investments by requiring a transparent and binding international arbitration mechanism and allowing investor -state arbitration for breaches of investment agreements if certain parameters are met.

The law permits contracting parties to agree to submit disputes to international arbitration, provided that the parties are domiciled in different countries, the place of arbitration agreed to by the parties is a country other than the one where they are domiciled, the subject matter of the arbitration involves the interests of more than one country, and the dispute has a direct impact on international trade. The law lets parties set their own arbitration terms including location, procedures, and the nationality of rules and arbiters. International arbitration is not allowed for the settlement of investor-state disputes arising from legal stability contracts, even for foreign investors. Foreign investors have found the arbitration process in Colombia complex and dilatory, especially with regard to enforcing awards. In October 2012, the new National and International Arbitration Statute, modeled after the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, took effect. Colombia is a member of the New York Convention on Investment Disputes, the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes, and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency.

**Duration of Dispute Resolution**

Domestic commercial litigation takes on average 885 days from the pretrial stage until the final hearing and judgment. Traditionally, most court proceedings are carried out in writing and only the evidence-gathering stage is carried out through hearings, including witness depositions, site inspections, and cross-examinations. The Colombian government has accelerated proceedings and reduced the backlog of court cases by allowing more verbal public hearings and creating alternative court mechanisms. The new Code of General Procedure that will enter in force in June 2014 also establishes an oral proceeding which is carried out in two hearings, and there are now penalties for not ruling in the time limit set by the law. Enforcement of an arbitral award can take up to two years.
