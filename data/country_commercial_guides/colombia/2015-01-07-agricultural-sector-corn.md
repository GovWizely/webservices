####Overview [Return to top](#chap4)


Colombia’s yellow corn production is challenged by low productivity and is very susceptible to weather conditions and plant pests. As a result, about 60 percent of the market is satisfied by imports. Colombian imports of U.S. corn have fallen in recent years because of high prices and strong competition from MERCOSUR. Colombian corn demand is expected to increase because of growing feed needs from the Colombian poultry sector. Under the FTA, U.S. yellow and white corn are subject to a tariff-rate-quota (TRQ) to be phased out over 12 years.

####Best Prospects/Services [Return to top](#chap4)

The FTA has improved market conditions for U.S. corn against MERCOSUR competitors. The United States is poised to take advantage of TRQ preferences, in addition to quality and shipping cost differences to attract Colombian buyers. U.S. corn can take advantage of more competitive trade conditions against MERCOSUR corn, which is subject to a price band mechanism, where duties fluctuate based on a reference price.

####Opportunities [Return to top](#chap4)

Corn imports will increase in the following years due to: 1) a continued growth of the Colombian economy and a relatively strong Colombian peso; and, 2) a rising middle

88 class and shifting dietary patterns towards more animal protein that generates a significant demand for more animal feed to satisfy primarily the poultry and swine sectors.
