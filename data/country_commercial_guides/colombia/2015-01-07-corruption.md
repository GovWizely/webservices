UN Anticorruption Convention, OECD Convention on Combatting Bribery Corruption Corruption is a significant challenge in Colombia. According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Index (2013-2014), corruption is the biggest problem for doing business in Colombia. The Colombian Attorney General estimates that corrupt activity drains $2.1 billion per year from the country’s economy. According to the “AmericasBarometer 2013” published by the Latin American Public Opinion Project, the perception of corruption in Colombia reached 81.7 percent, its highest level since the study was first carried out in 2004. Similarly, the latest Survey of Colombian Companies’ Anti-Bribery Practices, carried out in 2012, found that 94 percent of businesspeople believed their peers offered bribes and that 58 percent of companies lacked mechanisms for reporting cases of bribery. Responders said that corruption increases the cost of projects almost 15 percent, particularly for government contracts.

President Santos has demonstrated his commitment to prosecute corrupt officials and tackle fraud and bribery in the use of public funds. In 2011, he signed the Anti-Corruption Statute, a comprehensive policy giving the government new tools to crackdown on corruption, including stiffer penalties. Santos has also uncovered multiple high-profile scandals involving the public sector since taking office, and numerous officials have been dismissed, taken to court, or put in jail. In 2013, the Customs and Tax Office (DIAN) was involved in a high-profile corruption case that is still pending in which a number of employees nationwide stole approximately $90 million.

Colombia has adopted the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials and is a member of the OECD Anti-Bribery Committee. It has signed and ratified the UN Anticorruption Convention. Additionally, it has adopted the OAS Convention against Corruption.

The FTA protects the integrity of procurement practices and criminalizes both offering and soliciting bribes to/from public officials. It requires both countries to make all laws, regulations, and procedures regarding any matter under the FTA publicly available.

Both countries must also establish procedures for reviews and appeals by any entities affected by actions, rulings, measures, or procedures under the FTA.
