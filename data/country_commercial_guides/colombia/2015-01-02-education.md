####Overview [Return to top](#chap4)

U.S. colleges and universities remain the preferred overseas destination for Colombian students, despite significant competition from other countries like the United Kingdom, Spain, France and Argentina. There are several reasons that make the United States a leading destination, chief among them higher employment opportunities after graduation, the chance to improve English skills, and the high quality of education. The preferred states for Colombian students are California, New York, Texas, Massachusetts, Illinois and Florida.

According to the Institute of International Education, Colombia is ranked 22nd in the world and 2nd among South American Countries (after Brazil) in sending students to the United States.

####Best Prospects/Services [Return to top](#chap4)

In academic year 2012/2013, 6,543 Colombian students traveled to the United States to study. That constitutes a 3.9 percent increase over the previous year.

The U.S. Embassy in Bogota supports efforts to increase the number of Colombian students studying in the United States by supporting technology projects such as Ed, a 24/7 virtual adviser in Spanish and various micro scholarships for English Language learning. The approval of the United States-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (FTA) has increased foreign investment and the need of academic mobility and exchange.

Additionally, President Obama launched the initiative “100,000 Strong in the Americas,” in March 2011, which intends to increase the number of Latin American students studying in the United States and the number of U.S. students studying in Latin America. The U.S. Commercial Service in cooperation with the Education USA offices in Colombia has supported various education fairs that included the participation of U.S. boarding schools, universities and ESL institutions, in order to promote their programs in Colombia.

Given the demands of modern day society, the number of Colombian undergraduate and graduate students in the United States is increasing slowly. Colombians know it is difficult to obtain a high level position within the government or an important national or multinational company without proficient English skills and/or a Masters Degree. The most demanding field of studies are those focused on business administration, management, finance, banking, marketing, and engineering.

Under government-to-government or private agreements, both public and private universities in Colombia have developed programs with universities in the United States, Europe and Latin America. Priority is given to projects that foster post-graduate programs for training professors as well as research to enhance teaching.


Most scholarships are awarded through two institutions, one of which is the Colombian Institute for Educational Loans and Technical Studies Abroad (ICETEX, by its initials in Spanish), which is dedicated to finance higher education through the system of payback financial aid that allows students to start or continue their higher education either in country or abroad. During 2013 ICETEX awarded 837 scholarships for Master’s and PhD programs. The second institution is COLFUTURO, which is a non-profit organization that provides funds to Colombian professionals/students to study abroad. Their loan program is available to students who have been accepted to graduate programs at foreign universities. During 2013 COLFUTURO awarded 1,112 scholarships: 956 for Master’s programs and 156 for PhD programs. Overall, 246 of those scholarships were for programs in the United States.

COLFUTURO also has agreements with many universities such as: Carnegie Mellon - Heinz College, Columbia, Duke, Johnson School of Management - Cornell University, Kogod School of Business - American University, The Krannert School of Management - Purdue University, Tulane University, and Harvard University.

####Opportunities [Return to top](#chap4)

Not only can a greater number of Colombian students now afford to study in the United States, but newly created employment opportunities in Colombia also make American degrees even more valuable. International education is highly valued in Colombia. A recent survey of employers found that 58 percent preferred to hire people who had earned advanced degrees abroad.

The approval of the FTA has increased foreign investment and the need of academic mobility and exchange. This will result in the increase of the enrollment of Colombian students at American academic institutions in the foreseeable future.

Beyond the economic implications, the availability of educational services carries even greater significance in terms of improving general living conditions in Colombia. A well-educated Colombian population will be vital to the country’s economic growth and global competitiveness over the long term. U.S. educational services will also expose more Colombians to American culture, further strengthening ties between the two countries.

There are concrete opportunities to increase the number of Colombian students attending U.S. universities. Those wishing to attract Colombian students should consider actively increasing recruitment campaigns in order to raise their visibility. Financial Aid/scholarship opportunities and information on the process to obtain a U.S. student visa are essential topics for U.S. educational institutions when promoting themselves in Colombia.

In Colombia, there is a strong network of 11 Education USA centers administering language programs and doing extensive outreach around the country. Advising centers are located at 9 binational centers, the Fulbright commission and COLFUTURO.
