Government entities, institutions, and commercial enterprises must follow the provisions of Law 80 of October 31, 1993, which regulates purchases made and contracts entered into by the government and state industrial and commercial enterprises.

Under Law 80, Colombian government contracting agencies must select contractors through a public competitive bidding process. There are a few exceptions to this rule, which are clearly established in Article 24 of Law 80. The following are some exceptions for a direct contracting procedure:

(1) Contracts for minor amounts: minor amounts are expressed in multiples of the established Colombian legal minimum monthly salary (currently about US$ 261 without the additional benefits and/or compensation pay). A minor amount may range from 25 minimum monthly salaries to 1,000 minimum monthly salaries, depending on the annual budget of the contracting entity. For instance:

If the annual budget of the contracting entity is less than or equal to 6,000 minimum monthly salaries, it is allowed to acquire goods and services under direct contract that do not exceed 25 minimum monthly salaries in value;

If the annual budget of the contracting agency is equal to or exceeds 1,200,000 minimum monthly salaries, under direct contracts it may purchase goods and services that do not exceed 1,000 monthly salaries in value;

Loan agreements: inter-agency administrative contracts, professional, scientific and technological services, and evident emergencies and;

Non-award: Whenever bidding is not awarded for reasons such as: lack of proposals submitted, when the bids do not meet the terms of reference or specifications, when there is only one bidder, when products originating in or destined to agriculture or livestock breeding are offered through legally organized commodities exchanges, and in contracts executed by state (government) entities for the rendering of health services.

In July 2007 the Colombian government issued Law 1150 which is an amendment to Law 80. The following are the most important changes to Law 80 according to the law firm Prieto and Carrizosa:

Sets out four principles for contracting with the government via: (i) public tender,

short list (iii) competitive examinations and (iv) direct contracting

Provides that the specifications should include the methodology for risk sharing within the contract

Develops the principle of objective selection, stating the criteria of how the contractor will be chosen. It eliminates experience, financial capacity, and organizational capacity as requirements for selection. These conditions will be taken into consideration for scoring purposes.

Expands the possibilities of checking the conditions of the bidders through a National Bidders Registry (Registro Unico Empresarial or RUE).

Requires the application of sound fiscal and functional principles when contracting with the State in addition to the rules already established by the State.

Sets parameters for extension or adding up to 60 percent to concession contracts for public works regardless of the amount of investment.

Foreign individuals or companies not domiciled in Colombia or foreign private legal entities without a branch in Colombia that are interested in government contracts must appoint an agent or legal representative, domiciled in Colombia, who is duly authorized to bid on and execute the contracts as well as to represent the foreign enterprise in and out of court. They also must provide a copy of their registration with the corresponding registry in their country of origin and submit documents proving their constitution or incumbency whichever is the case. This law applies to direct sales or international tenders.

The FTA’s Government Procurement Chapter provides significant opportunities for U.S. companies to supply their goods and services to the Colombian government with strong procedures that apply to the conduct of the procurement. At the same time, the agreement’s government procurement rules ensure that certain U.S. business sectors – such as small businesses or textile companies bidding on Department of Defense procurement – continue to receive the same protections they have in other agreements, and also ensure that U.S. environmental and labor safeguards will be maintained.

As a general rule, all individuals and legal entities wishing to enter into contracts with state entities must register with the chamber of commerce in their jurisdiction in order to be qualified, classified, and rated in accordance with the provisions of Law 80. Foreign bidders and/or suppliers of equipment and services are also required to register with a Colombian chamber of commerce under the Bidders Register (Registro Unico de Proponentes) and, in most instances, must be pre-classified and pre-qualified by the chamber and, in some cases, by the Colombian government contracting agency.

The requirement for both the Bidders Register and the Merchants Register with a local chamber of commerce will be replaced shortly by a Sole Entrepreneurial Register (Registro Unico Empresarial or RUE), which comprises a more complete profile on all business people, businesses, enterprises, contractors, and bidders for qualifying for executing contracts with government entities.

The State Contracting Information System (Sistema de Información de Contratación Estatal or SICE) is a database introduced on May 1, 2002. Its purpose is to register and provide certificates for foreign and domestic suppliers of all types of commodities and services, their products, and prices in order to be able to enter into contracts with state agencies and industrial and commercial enterprises. One can also register via Internet in accordance with the Sole Catalog of Goods and Services (Catalogo Unico de Bienes y Servicios or CUBS), which is a listing of goods and services classified, standardized, and codified with the products that may be acquired by government entities. Registration is subject to a minimal fee, which depends on the net profit of the company. SICE is expected to become a database with 3,000 municipal, state and national entities, and more than 100,000 suppliers.

Although Law 80 has made the government contracting system more dynamic, Colombia is still not a signatory to the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) though they act as an observer to the GPA. There have been frequent, legitimate complaints of a lack of transparency and rule changes during the award of major government contracts. The RUE and SICE systems explained above are expected to become useful tools for better transparency in the process of contracting with government entities.

Colombia is still struggling to refine the requirements of Law 80, which calls for open bidding in public tenders. Attempts are being made to amend the law to clarify procedures. Despite the law, transparency, fairness, and truly competitive bidding conditions in many tenders remain uncertain. The Colombian government is also resorting to auctions for the purchase of high tech or complex equipment or medicines. These factors continue to be significant market access barriers. U.S. companies interested in public sector contracts should obtain legal counsel in Colombia and contact the U.S. Commercial Service for assistance and possible advocacy.

Certificate of Reciprocity: The Colombian Government procurement statute seeks to establish simple procedures based on the principles of transparency and objective selection; it provides equal treatment of foreign companies on a reciprocal basis. The procurement statute impedes complete access by U.S. firms since it requires a certificate of reciprocity. The principle of reciprocity embodied in Laws 80 and 816 ensure national treatment under the same conditions for Colombian bidders in other countries. The U.S. Government is unable to provide such a certificate, as each of the 50 U.S. states acts as a separate commercial jurisdiction. The Department of State, however, provides a certificate that U.S. companies may offer in lieu of a statement certifying reciprocity. Certificates can be obtained from the Economic section of the U.S. Embassy in Bogotá. Companies requiring this document should be prepared to provide the following information: company name, tender name, tender number, name of the Colombian entity letting the tender, and the general purpose of the tender.

Colombian military contracts above a certain amount (more than US$ 1 million for equipment and more than US$5 million for ammunition) require the foreign company to offer an “offset” proposal. Contact the U.S. Commercial Service for further information about this requirement.

Because of the FTA U.S. firms are given national treatment and for all federal government tenders the U.S. companies are required to be treated the same as Colombian companies bidding on the tender.
