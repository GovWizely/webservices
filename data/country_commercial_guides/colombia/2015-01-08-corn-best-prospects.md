<div id="corn-best-prospects">
The FTA has improved market conditions for U.S. corn against MERCOSUR competitors. The United States is poised to take advantage of TRQ preferences, in addition to quality and shipping cost differences to attract Colombian buyers. U.S. corn can take advantage of more competitive trade conditions against MERCOSUR corn, which is subject to a price band mechanism, where duties fluctuate based on a reference price.
