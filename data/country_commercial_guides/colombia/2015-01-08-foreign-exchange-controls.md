Colombia imposes no foreign exchange controls on trade. However, exchange regulations require that the following transactions be channeled through intermediaries (i.e. banks or other recognized financial institutions) authorized for such purposes, and must be declared to the Central Bank:

* Imports and exports of goods
* External loans and related financing costs 
* Investment of capital from abroad and remittances of profits thereon
* Investment of Colombian capital abroad, as well as remittances of yields 
* Investment in foreign securities and assets and their associated profits 
* Endorsements and guarantees in foreign currency
* Derivative or secondary financial operations, e.g. forwards, swaps, caps, floors, or collars.

Colombia has reduced foreign exchange controls significantly in recent years. External Resolution No. 6 of 2000 abolished prior deposit requirements with the Central Bank for

129 public and private external loans as well as for foreign financing of imports into Colombia. Also, Resolution 11 allows residents to make payments to other residents in U.S. dollars through checking accounts held abroad, and Resolution 8 authorizes stock brokerage firms to act as intermediaries in the foreign exchange market. The Colombian peso is convertible and investors report no untoward restrictions on access to hard currency.

Projects performed by companies with foreign capital in special sectors such as the exploration and production of oil, natural gas, coal, nickel, and uranium are subject to a special foreign exchange policy. Under the special policy, investors are not bound to repatriate export-generated foreign currency. Companies devoted to technical services related to hydrocarbon exploration and production activities may carry out operations in a foreign currency with no repatriation obligation. Furthermore, foreign investors are not obligated to reimburse Colombia with foreign currency obtained from the sale of products from these operations. Expenses incurred abroad that are related to the development of these projects must be paid in foreign currency. Companies interested in being covered by these special provisions must notify the central bank.

The Ministry of Finance issued Decree 4145 on November 5, 2010 reinstating a withholding tax of 33 percent on interest paid on foreign debt. This decree will raise the cost of capital for local borrowers. The purpose of the decree is to reduce the inflow of foreign currency. Decree 4145 does not supersede a lower rate of withholding tax provided for in Colombiaâ€™s tax treaties with Spain and Chile.
