<div id="soybean-meal-opportunities">
The FTA has created new opportunities for U.S. exporters and investment opportunities for new oilseed crushing facilities and feed manufacturing plants in Colombia. Soybean meal imports will continue to increase in the following years due to a rising middle class and shifting dietary patterns towards more animal protein that generates a significant demand for more animal feed to satisfy primarily the poultry and swine sectors.
