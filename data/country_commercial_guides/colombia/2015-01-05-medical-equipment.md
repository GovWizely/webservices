Colombia is the 22nd largest market for U.S. medical equipment exports. During 2012, the United States exported US$365.6 million in medical equipment to Colombia. The medical device market relies on imports for around 80 percent of the market. Since the signing of the United States- Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (commonly referred to as the FTA) in 2012, 96 percent of U.S. Medical equipment exports to Colombia receive duty free treatment.

The Colombian medical device market was valued at US$1.2 billion in 2013, ranking fourth in Latin America. It is one of the world's ten fastest growing medical device markets. The market is expected to almost double in value in the next five years, reaching US$2.2 billion in 2018.

Due to the 1993 health care reform, also known as Law 100, Colombia benefits from one of the most extensive insurance systems and medical financial protection in Latin America, second only to Chile. This reform created the social security system and covers standards governing the general system of pensions, workplace injury insurance and complementary social services. Currently approximately 80 percent of the Colombian population is covered by health insurance, and the Government of Colombia (GOC) sees universal health insurance coverage as a goal.

The country’s healthcare infrastructure is adequate in the larger urban areas, but is in need of modernization. The healthcare system is complex, and coverage is not yet universal. Currently the Colombian Congress is working to develop an updated health care reform law, which they expect would modernize the system.

According to Espicom (A Bussiness Monitor International Company for Medical Devices and Pharmaceuticals) “the Colombian medical device market has benefitted from the country's increasing political stability and GDP growth above the Latin American average in recent years. It now ranks fourth in Latin America and is projected to register one of

the world's top 10 fastest 2013- 2018 medical device CAGRs (Compound Annual Growth Rate). Per capita medical device expenditure is low but healthcare and regulatory developments implemented over the last three years will provide new growth opportunities for medical device companies in the long-term. Multinationals that already have a presence in the Latin American market will have a distinct advantage over new entrants.”

According to a study by America Economia Intelligence, seven of the twenty best hospitals and clinics in Latin America in 2013 were located in Colombia. In fourth place is the Fundacion Valle del Lili in Cali, in sixth is Fundacion Cardioinfantil in Bogota, in eighth Fundacion Cardiovascular de Colombia in Bucaramanga, in tenth Hospital Pablo Tobon in Medellin, in fourteenth Centro Medico Imbanaco in Cali, in nineteenth Clinica las Americas in Medellin, and in twentieth Hospital San Ignacio de Bogota.

U.S. imports enjoy the largest share of the Colombian market, accounting for around a third of all medical equipment imports. Currently the strongest competitors are China, Germany and Japan. China is quickly increasing market share. With the May 2012 implementation of the FTA, tariffs on 96 percent of U.S. medical equipment exports to Colombia went from an average of 7.6 percent (ranging from zero up to 15 percent) to zero. Colombia also has FTAs with our leading medical device producers such as the European Union and Canada.

Intellectual Property Rights:

The FTA requires high levels of intellectual property protection and enforcement, consistent with U.S. and international standards, and will support the growth of trade in valuable digital and other intellectual property-based products. The FTA also provides enhanced protections for trademarks, copyrights, and patents, such as the implementation of a Colombian electronic trademark application system and on-line database, prohibition on the circumvention of technological protection measures used by copyright holders, and requirements for the parties to provide robust patent and test data protection.

####Best Products/Services [Return to top](#chap4)

Best prospects for U.S. medical equipment manufacturers include:

* Medical, surgical, dental and veterinary instruments
* Electro-diagnostic apparatus
* Orthopedics devices
* Prosthetic devices
* Diagnostic imaging equipment
* Laboratory equipment and consumables
* Ultrasound, mammography and cardiovascular equipment.
* Dermatological and laser treatment apparatus and apparel (boosted by medical tourism and expanding plastic surgery demand)
* Intensive care, cardiology, neurology and oncology related equipment

It is expected that a number of Colombia’s clinical laboratories will be upgraded in the near future, which will provide an opportunity for exporters of clinical laboratory equipment. Opportunities also remain in medical, surgical, dental and veterinary instruments and electro medical equipment.

####Opportunities [Return to top](#chap4)

In 2012 Colombia imported medical equipment and supplies valued at US$1.02 billion, the highest level ever. Of this total, US$359 million was from the United States. The medical device industry is concentrated around the capital of Bogota. Per capita spending on medical devices is average for the region. While there is some domestic capacity for manufacturing basic items, the medical device market is heavily reliant on imports, especially for more high-tech items. A few multinationals manufacture within the country.

In addition, Colombia is seriously promoting the country as a health destination (Health/Medical Tourism). Colombia is well known in Latin America and the rest of the world as a pioneer and leader in health services, positioning the country as one of the most attractive destinations to receive medical treatments. This becomes an important market opportunity for the United States because the success of this industry requires high quality standards, technology and infrastructure. This has led Colombian hospital and clinic management to upgrade existing facilities, adding/renewing medical equipment and providing English language training for their staff.

The best approach to enter into this market is through distributors, as companies really prefer to buy from someone located in Colombia that can provide after-sales services when needed. Although distribution and sales of imported medical equipment in Colombia is handled principally through importers, distributors, representatives, and agents, an increasing percentage of materials, supplies, and equipment, is imported directly by end-users. U.S. manufacturers should maintain close contact with end-users and provide training and demonstrations so end-users can familiarize themselves with the equipment. This strategy is being used effectively in Colombia by European and Japanese manufacturers.

**Registration Process**

U.S. companies should be aware that medical devices require registration at the “Instituto Nacional de Vigilancia de Medicamentos y Alimentos” (INVIMA), the country’s medical device regulator. It is strongly recommended that U.S. companies process the registration under their name and not under the local distributor name, as if it is listed under the local distributor name, the U.S. company will not be able to change or add distributors, during the lifetime of the registration, which is ten years. Classification of devices in Colombia follows a four-tiered risk model (Class I, Class IIa, Class IIb and Class III). Colombia’s device classification scheme is similar to those of the European Union and other Global Harmonization Task Force (GHTF) systems. If the device falls into a lower-risk category in Colombia (Class I or IIa), the company may qualify for an expedited review process and achieve market entry in a shorter time.

INVIMA is working on new medical device regulations that are expected to be released in 2014.

Access to this market is not easy for newcomers. The market is mature and competitive, with many foreign firms selling medical equipment and medical products. It should be noted that registration procedures can often be challenging and may pose a barrier to entry into this market.

Here are three firms that do product registration.
