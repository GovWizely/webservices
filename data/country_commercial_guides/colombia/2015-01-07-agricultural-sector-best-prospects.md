Strong foreign direct investment in Colombia is likely to continue and although the Colombian peso has slightly weakened against the dollar, the impact on imports from the United States will be negligible.

Historically, Chile has been the principal supplier of imported fresh fruits to Colombia, but Colombian retailers are seeking to increase their supply of U.S. fruits, such as apples, pears and other products. Foreign competition in wine is primarily from Chile, Argentina, Spain, and France. Marketing efforts continue to introduce and expand high-quality U.S. wines to a growing consumer base in Colombia. South American countries receive a preferential duty as members of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) and/or the Andean Community of Nations. The implementation of the U.S.-Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (FTA) effectively removed import duties for most consumer oriented products; however, some products still have a 5-year phase out period.

Although the production of domestic processed foods is growing, imports play an increasingly important role to meet a growing consumer demand and changes in tastes and preferences. Sustained economic growth in the past two years and strong competition in the supermarket sector has also had an important impact on imports. The United States is the principal foreign supplier of consumer oriented food products to Colombia. U.S. food products are highly regarded in the Colombian market for their quality and value as well as for their wide diversity.
