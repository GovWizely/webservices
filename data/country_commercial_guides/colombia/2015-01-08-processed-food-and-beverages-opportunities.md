The FTA is providing duty-free access on 77 percent of all agricultural tariff lines, accounting for 52 percent of current U.S. exports to Colombia. Colombia will eliminate most other tariffs on agricultural products within 15 years. Duty-free treatment is also extended to most processed food products, including pastry and dessert mixes, spices, condiments (except mayonnaise), frozen vegetables, processed turkey, beer, wine, nuts, soup preparations, soft drinks, cookies, snacks, and chips, among others. Before the FTA these products had an average tariff of between 5 and 20 percent.

**The following product categories represent the major export opportunities, and emerging opportunities, for U.S. food products with zero duties entering Colombia:**

According to a recent consumer survey by Raddar Consumer Knowledge Group, about 80 percent of Colombian households associate with specific food brands that are regularly included in shopping lists. The following branded products are increasing in retail market share: canned/processed food, dried processed food, frozen processed food, meal solutions, oils and fats, ready-to-eat meals, sauces, dressings and condiments.

There are a number of reasons why the mass grocery retail sector is expected to continue to grow:

* Colombia has the third largest economy in Latin America; foreign retailers have invested significantly in the country's mass grocery retail sector since the 1990s. 
* Significant growth is expected, particularly in the superstore and smaller supermarket, or 'express' store, formats. 
* The Colombian mass grocery retail sector is among the most developed in the region, making it relatively easy to introduce new products. 
* A well-developed retail sector is a strong outlet for packaged and value-added food products. 
* A young population, rising disposable income and an increasing number of working women are fuelling demand for higher-value, processed goods. 
* Increased health consciousness is creating opportunities in this high-value sector. 
* Soft drinks sales are expected to increase by approximately 33 percent over the next five-years. 
* Consumption of soft drinks is below average for the region, suggesting that the sector has strong potential for growth.

Critical considerations for market entry include the following:

* Competition is based on quality, price and service;
* U.S. suppliers should develop ways to meet the needs of the Colombian market through personal visits to better understand the market and identify needs of buyers and consumer trends;
* Many Colombian companiesâ€™ representatives visit trade shows in the United States, such as Food and Beverage of the Americas and Fancy Foods Show, which are great opportunities for U.S. exporters to meet and educate Colombian importers;
* Develop, to the extent possible, Spanish marketing/communication materials; 
* Work closely with local importers to comply with food import regulations to facilitate the registration and import of food products and minimize port of entry risks

The best approach to enter the Colombian market is through distributors. In order to import and distribute beverage products into Colombia, products must be registered with the Colombian National Institute for Surveillance of Medicines and Food (INVIMA). It is necessary to obtain a Mandatory Sanitary Notification (Sanitary Registry). One of the requirements for this notification is the Certificate of Free Sale. Registration is valid for ten years but only for the applicant (exporter or importer) and the manufacturer specified on it. It is highly recommended that the U.S. exporter apply for sanitary registration, as if this is done by the importer, they will control the product in Colombia for the duration of the ten year registration. Here are three firms that do product registration.

Please be advised that this is not an exhaustive list and they do not constitute a recommendation on our part to use any of the mentioned firms.

Colombia requires country-of-origin labeling for processed food products. However, frozen vegetables are not classified as a processed food and therefore no country of

origin labeling is required. Also, fresh fruit and vegetables do not require country of origin labeling. Product labeling information on imported processed products must be present at the point of retail sale. The responsibility for this labeling information rests with the importer, not the retailer. Many Colombian importers arrange for this information to be placed on the product by the exporting firm, before it enters Colombia. Labels on processed food products must indicate the specific name of the product, ingredients in order of predominance, name and address of manufacturer and importer, number of units, instructions for storage and usage (when required), and expiration date.
