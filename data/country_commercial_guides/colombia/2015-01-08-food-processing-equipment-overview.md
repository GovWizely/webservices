The Colombian Processed Food and Beverage Equipment market caters to an industry that produces approximately US$22 billion in revenue per year. The food industry is comprised of 10 sub sectors: sugar mills, rice mill, cereal mills, oils and fats, dairy products, chocolates and candy, meat products, animal food products, bread and pasta, and others. The beverage industry is also comprised of three subsectors: beer, carbonated soft drinks and juices, and spirits.

The food and beverage processing and packaging (FPP) industry employs about 19.3 percent of the domestic labor force, concentrated in the five main metropolitan areas of Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Cartagena and Barranquilla. FPP equipment from the United States enjoys an excellent reputation and is widely accepted in the Colombian market due to high quality, outstanding customer service, a favorable exchange rate and low shipping costs. The strongest U.S. competitors are Italy, Brazil and Germany. Although the U.S. product participation decreased about 10 percent in 2013 compared to 2012, the potential market for U.S. equipment remains high.

In 2013 the food industry grew approximately 9 percent, compared to 6 percent in 2012, while the beverage industry is still recovering from a decrease in sales in 2010. Within these industries, the dairy, animal food and carbonated soft drinks and juices sectors were the three markets highlighted as the most attractive in terms of supply machinery and equipment. To put into perspective the importance of the food and beverage import market, this industry accounts for 5.4 percent of all Colombian imports. In other words, of the approximately US$59 billion of imports into Colombia in 2012, imports to supply the food and beverage industry totaled US$ 3.18 billion.

Among the most important sectors in the food processing equipment industry in Colombia are sugar mills, rice mills, cereal mills industry, the oils and fats sector, dairy products, the chocolate and candy industries, and the meat and beverage sectors. Most of the equipment and raw materials required for those industries are imported. The implementation of the United States -Colombia Trade Promotion Agreement (commonly referred to as the FTA) will increase opportunities for U.S. exporters on this Industry.
