#####Overview

Argentina’s cattle herd is approximately 51 million head. Roughly 2.1 million cows are in dairy production, and about 20.9 million cows are for beef production. The quality of both dairy and beef herds are very good, but need to continuously incorporate the latest high quality genetics to keep up the standard. The majority of imported semen is from dairy breeds, but imports of beef genetics have increased significantly over the past few years. The U.S. accounts for almost two-thirds of the total imported semen market, followed by Canada.

#####Sub-Sector Best Prospects

Both dairy and beef semen (especially Angus) have good potential growth in 2014.

Return to Top

#####Opportunities

Anticipated good returns in both dairy and beef sectors will continue to encourage new investment, including a larger use of artificial insemination and the use of higher quality genetics. The use of beef semen with production data is increasing, but semen distributors indicate that much needed education has to be done with breeders. Overall, imports of Black and Red Angus, Braford, Brangus, and Hereford semen have the greatest potential. Semen of Black and Red Angus and, to a lesser extent, Brangus have the greatest opportunities from the United States.

#####Overview

The food and beverage (F&B) industry is one of the main industries contributing to the Argentine economy, accounting for 33 percent of Argentina’s total exports. Some of its main trends are as follows: 1. significant investments in technology updates; 2. local production capacity being fully used, which requires additional investments to supply the growing food demand; 3. “Health and Nutrition” considered a strong concept in the F&B business; 4. greater interaction between the local industry and universities, fostering innovation.

The main ingredients imported were those that are not manufactured locally or their production is not sufficient to supply the local industry. There is a significant market for some U.S. food ingredients among local producers of ingredients, who use them to manufacture high-value, tailor-made food products. However, Argentine F&B imports for 2013 are projected to slightly decline, as a result of the slowdown of the country’s economy, and the trade restrictive measures taken by the government of Argentina (GOA) which are adversely affecting imports. The GOA is expected to continue to closely monitor imports as a means of trying to maintain a surplus trade balance by restricting imports and promoting exports.

#####Opportunities

U.S. food ingredients are locally considered to be high quality and safe products. As a consequence of the declining value of the Argentine peso vis-à-vis the dollar, U.S. products are still more competitive than European products. Best opportunities are for tailor-made food ingredients that are demanded for the manufacturing of more sophisticated food items, and ingredients that are not produced locally

#####Overview

The Argentine seed industry offers numerous growth prospects and opportunities in terms of
an increase in the demand for genetically modified seeds, higher commodity prices, and the
expansion of agricultural land area. Planting seeds are one of the most important agricultural
products imported into Argentina from the United States, totaling $23 million in 2012.

#####Sub-Sector Best Prospects

Alfalfa continues to be the primary seed imported from the United States, followed by yellow
corn, clover, rye grass, and fescue. Likewise, seeds from vegetable crops and lawn grass seed
have been in demand.

Return to Top

#####Opportunities

Off-season production of corn and soybean seed has generated positive returns in the last few
years. Total exports of planting seeds for 2013 are estimated at $190 million. Total exports
of planting seeds for 2012 were $163 million. 

The new development of marginal areas for beef and dairy industries will mean that demand
for quality forage seeds will remain high. There is a strong demand for grasses suitable for
sub-tropical regions in the northern part of the country.
