#####Market Estimates

![Argentina](../images/it-market-estimates.png)

#####Overview

By 2011, Argentina was well along the path of developing its domestic industry in the software and IT services sectors. The software and computer services industry in Argentina has approximately 40,000 qualified workers spread among 1,000 companies that invoice around $1,600 million and $300 million in software and IT services exports. By the end of 2012, the industry employed nearly 67,000 workers and increased revenues to almost $3 billion, including more than $700 million in exports. CESSI, the Argentine Chamber of Software and IT Services Companies, projects 12 percent growth in 2013.

Argentina has one of the most developed broadband markets in Latin America, with some of the fastest and least expensive plans. At 14.3 percent at year-end 2012, penetration is among the highest in the region. The main broadband technologies are cable modem and ADSL. Fixed wireless and satellite broadband account for about 1 percent of the market, while FttH is just starting. Broadband demand is expected to continue rising, particularly in areas outside of Buenos Aires.

Four main factors will keep demand for software and IT services high in 2013:

•	the majority of the systems installed need upgrading

•	the growth of Internet access (fixed and mobile)

•	the increasing complexity and convergence of technologies

•	highly educated and tech-savvy population

#####Sub-Sector Best Prospects

The IT Services sub-sector offers major opportunities for U.S. companies in network implementation, management and maintenance, legacy applications, wireless LANs, RTE (real time infrastructure) implementations, remote operation processing, back-up, critical mission services, disaster recovery systems, Internet and network security systems, document digitalization, digital asset management, storage, utility computing, and information systems for rural areas (traceability, RFID, etc.). Cloud computing and virtualization-related services will see high demand during 2013. The outsourcing of software development and call/contact centers will continue to see new investments, exports, and increased sales in the domestic market.

Other market conditions will foster growth in IT services throughout 2013, such as the increased use of e-banking, electronic commerce, and E-Government, which have increased the awareness related to information technology security. Regarding software, large projects in the areas of security solutions and business intelligence will present opportunities in 2013.

#####Opportunities

The following main factors will keep demand for IT hardware, software, and services high, with increased competition in 2013:

•	new investments in the country in a number of industries (e.g., tourism)

•	new mobile number portability law

•	tendering of remaining frequencies to offer mobile services and satellite TV services

•	nationwide extension of fiber optic lines under the Argentina Conectada program

In the telecom sector, investments in 2013 will focus on four areas: deployment and enhancement of the cellular GSM network (3G+), expansion of broadband Internet access (via ADSL, cable modem, Wi-fi, Wi-Max, 3G USB modems, and smart phones), expansion of data transmission/broadband and content over cellular networks, and the continuing migration to IP networks (NGN) and triple play.

Argentina continues to present many opportunities to U.S. exporters. However, the Argentine Government has imposed import and foreign exchange controls potentially affecting all exports to Argentina regardless of origin or product category. It is important for current and would-be exporters to Argentina to confirm that their Argentine customers have received all the necessary permits to import the goods and to acquire the foreign exchange to pay for the goods prior to shipment. (See “Trade Regulations and Standards” report for more information).
